# [128. Longest Consecutive Sequence - Explanation](https://neetcode.io/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/)

```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # first we will create a set of nums, to check membership of a  number in O(n)
        hashset = set(nums)
        max_consec = 0
        # for every num in hashset, so that we wont iterate through redundant values
        for num in hashset:
            # if there is no number before num, then num is starting 
            if (num-1) not in hashset:
                # we have the starting we have to look for next num in the hashset
                # we will create consec to store lenght of consecutive numbers
                consec = 1
                while num+consec in hashset:
                    # increase consec
                    consec += 1
                # compare consec with max_consec
                if consec > max_consec:
                    max_consec = consec
        return max_consec
```

### Time & Space Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(nn)
