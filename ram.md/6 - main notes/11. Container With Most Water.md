# [11. Container With Most Water](https://neetcode.io/problems/max-water-container/)

## 1. Brute Force

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        for i in range(len(heights)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(heights)):
                res = max(res, min(heights[i], heights[j]) * (j - i))
        return res
```

### Time & Space Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n2)
- Space complexity: O(1)

## 2. Two Pointers

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        # we will use converging pointers
        l, r = 0, len(height) - 1
        max_area = 0
        # loop until left and right cross each other
        while l < r:
            # calculate area
            area = min(height[l], height[r]) * (r-l)
            # update max_area if area is greater
            if area > max_area:
                max_area = area
            # since we start from the largest width
            # we only want to keep the heighest height of the left and right pointers
            # we will update the smaller height and look for a better height combination 
            # with the already greater height of the two pointers
            if height[l] > height[r] :
                r -= 1
            else :
                l += 1  
        return max_area

```

### Time & Space Complexity

- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(1)
