# What is cloud computing?
The practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than local server or personal computers.

Difference between **on-premise** and **cloud providers** 
- someone else takes up all responsibility for servers, hiring IT people, paying real estate or rent, while they are responsible for everything expect configuring cloud services and code.
## Evolution of cloud hosting 
1. **Dedicated server** - runs single web/app -very expensive, High maintenance and high security problems
2. **Virtual Private Server** - single server is divided into subsystems via virtualization where one server hosts a bunch of web/apps.
3. **Shared Hosting** - one physical machine but instead of virtually separating submachines every business is given a folder and all the businesses share the same machine to host. eg : GoDaddy - very cheap, very limited, underutilization and over utilization may impact workload.
4. **Cloud Hosting** - multiple machines having virtualization, highly distributed, best of all worlds - flexible, scalable, secure, cost effective, highly configurable.
# what is google cloud platform (GCP)?
**CSP** - Cloud Service provider - is a company that provides multiple cloud services.
## Benefits of cloud computing 
1. **cost effective** - *pay as you go(PAYG) or On-demand*, pay for what you consume while thousands of customers shares the cost of resources.
2. **Global** - launch workloads anywhere to the world, just choose a region.
3. **Secure** - CSP are secure by default or you have configure granularly.
4. **Reliable** - dat backup, disaster recovery, data replication, and fault tolerance.
5. **Scalable** - Increase and decrease resources and services based on demand.
6. **Elastic** - Automate scaling during spikes and drops in demand.
7. **Current and updated** - underlying hardware and software are patched, upgraded and replaced by the CSP.
## Common Cloud Services
There are hundreds of cloud services provided by several could providers, but generally all these services fall into these four categories within the IaaS.
1. **Compute** - virtual computer that can run applications, programs and code.
2. **Storage** - virtual hard drive that can store files.
3. **Networking** - virtual network that is able to define internet connections or isolate networks.
4. **Databases** - virtual database for storing reporting data or a database for general purpose web-application.

> *GCP has 60+ cloud services*
## Types of Cloud Computing

1. **Saas** - A product that is run and managed by the service provider.(For Customers)
2. **PaaS** - Let's customers focus on deployment and management of app and not worry about provisioning, configuring and working with the OS.
3. **IaaS** - Provides access to networking, computers, storage while taking care of IT staff, data centers and hardware.

> CSP - Provide IaaS
> Cloud Platform - Provide PaaS
