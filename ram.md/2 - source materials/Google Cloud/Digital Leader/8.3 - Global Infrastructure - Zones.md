# Global Infrastructure - Zones
A **Zone** is a physical location made up of one or more data center.

A region will * generally contain 3 zones.

Data center within a region will be isolated from each other. But thy will be close enough to provide low-latency 

Common practice : run workloads in a t least 3 Zones to ensure services remain available in case one or two data centers fail (High Availability)

After you have chosen you Region, you choose you Zone or Zones when launching cloud resources.

## Resource Scoping
A zone is a deployment area for Google Cloud resources within a region 
 - Zones should be considered a single failure domain within a region.
 - Deploy redundant resource in multiple zones (multi-zones) for fault tolerance and high availability.

Products or Services can be scoped based on, 
1. **Zonal** **resource** - resource resides in a single zone in a single region.
2. **Regional** **resources** - resources resides in multiple zones in a single region.
3. **Multi**-**regional** - resources resides across multiple specific zones.
4. **Global** **service** - Resources reside globally and regions and zones are abstracted away, very common with serverless services.
5. **Internal** **Services** - Foundational services used by many other services that don't interact with these services directly, they are managed by Google, for example Spanner, Colossus, Borg and Chubby.
