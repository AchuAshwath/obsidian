# Shared Responsibility Model

1. **SaaS** - only responsible for the Content, Access policy and the Usage.
2. **PaaS** - additionally gives control over deployment and the web application security.
3. **IaaS** - customer is responsible for *data* and **configuration** of *access control*, **configuration** of  *cloud services*  and granting access to users.
4. **Google** is responsible for the underlying Infrastructure. 

> A concept from AWS
> **Responsibility** 
>  - *in the cloud*  - if you can *configure* or store in the cloud then the customer (you) are responsible for it.
>  - *on the cloud*  - if you cannot *configure*, then Google is responsible for it.
