# Capital Expenditure vs Operational Expenditure

*Capital Expenditure* - Spending money upfront on physical infrastructure deducting that expense from you tax bill over time. For CAPEX you have to guess upfront on what you plan to spend.

*Operational Expenditure* - The costs associated with an on-premise datacenter that has shifted the cost to the service provider. The customer only has to be concerned with **non-physical costs.**

You can also try a product or service without investing in equipment, thus letting you spend a lot more time to grow you business rather than committing to a bunch of stuff.
