## Public Cloud
*aka : cloud native*
Everything built on top of the cloud provider.
Example : A virtual machine and a database are in subnets within a VPC and all of this is contained within the cloud service provider, no cloud services outside the cloud service provider is used.
- Used by startups and SaaS offering companies and new projects or companies such as [basecamp](https://basecamp.com/), [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/official-teams-page?_tk=paid_sem_goog_biz_b&_camp=1018334849&_kw=dropbox|e&_ad=666300362351||c&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiA7NO7BhDsARIsADg_hIbNJ7ydd47qCQR7msQCMFlLXQ6BGtNyebah6COY-clF5NtepO6HfFsaArTbEALw_wcB)and [square space](https://www.squarespace.com/?clickid=zVgVVzQrXxyKW1cVngSvwwwcUkCSca1%3ALwZmW40&irgwc=1&utm_medium=pp&utm_source=Rohtash%20Kumar&utm_campaign=Rohtash%20Kumar&channel=pp&subchannel=2534243&source=Rohtash%20Kumar)
## Private Cloud
*aka :  On Premise*
Everything is built on top of the company's data centers.
Example : **Open stack** - distribute VM's across several machines and IAM
- used by public sectors like Government, or super sensitive data such as hospitals or large Enterprise with heavy regulation such as Insurance company. 
## Hybrid Cloud
Uses both *On-Premise* and *Cloud Service Provider*
you are off-loading some of the compute and storage to public cloud via some hybrid connection
- used by banks, Fintech, Investment Management,  Large professional Service providers and Legacy on-premise because they have to keep certain data for regulatory reasons, or they have too much infrastructure to move everything to cloud.
## Cross Cloud
*aka : Multi-Cloud*
Using multiple cloud providers.
Example :  Amazon EKS - Azure arc - GCP kubernetes Engine
You use multiple CSP's but you don't necessarily share data across them, but Google uses multi-cloud and cross cloud as same terminologies.
