# GrowthSchool - Find your Objective & TG

## Five-step blueprint

1. Find your Objective and Target Audience
2. Optimize your LinkedIn Profile
3. The connection loop - finding the right set of people
4. Time for Content Magic
5. Playing the Outbound game

## Steps to glory on LinkedIn

It's three step process, 

1. Getting to first 5000 followers/connections.
2. Scaling from 5k to 30k followers/connections. 30k is the connection limit.
3. Flying beyond 30k followers.
## Defining you objective

Objective - what you want to achieve from LinkedIn

1. Generate leads for your business or a freelancer
2. Build a personal brand
3. get a new/ better/ high paying job

focus on one, and then other things will come together.
## Finding your target audience

To understand identifying who your target audience is you need to ask yourself, these questions

1. who do you help? - be more specific
2. what you help them achieve? 
3. How do you do that?

> you can't have different target audiences

*Examples*

*I help business generate more revenue*
*I help founders, raise money by helping them build*
*I help Game developers get more installs on their games using ASO*
*I help single moms generate passive income by teaching them embroidery online*
*I help lawyers get more clients using online marketing*
*I help ecommerce brands get better ROAS using FB Ads and CRO*
*I help SaaS startups improve their retention using copywriting*

**Personal Brand**

1. who are you? - not your name, 
2. who could benefit from you? - what are the kind of people who should follow you?

- Startup Founder - Potential clients. Investors, good talent, fellow entrepreneur
- Digital Marketer - Fellow DM, new marketers?
- Interior Designers - Other designers, real estate owners, new house owners

**Job Seeker**

1. what do you do? - what you want to do or become!
2. what are your dream companies? 
3. who could get you an interview from these companies?

- Software Developer - Google - hiring managers, similar role developers, senior roles 
## Takeaway - Assignment

Since I want to generate leads primarily and grow my personal brand, I have added more questions to my takeaway. then my questions can be summed up to these which will determine key fields of information that will go in my profile and connections.

1. who are you? - Indie Hacker

Ashwath, an Indie Hacker working as a Associate SDE in Edsols Innovation Private Limited.

**Entrepreneurial Full Stack Developer**  
_(Helping small businesses go digital | Flask, React, Next.js | Building open source & MVPs)_

Indie Hacker, Helping small businesses go digital | Full Stack Dev | AI & Open Source

I help small businesses and early-stage founders build custom web solutions and lightweight SaaS tools — from e-commerce sites to chatbots and internal dashboards — using Flask, React, and Next.js.

2. who could benefit from you?/ who do you help? and what you help them achieve

**I help small business owners, early-stage founders, and creative professionals build modern web solutions and lightweight digital products tailored to their goals.


**What I help them achieve:**  
• Digitize and modernize their business with fast, responsive web experiences  
• Launch MVPs quickly and validate ideas with functional, scalable tools  
• Automate customer interactions through chatbots and workflow solutions  
• Visualize and manage data with custom dashboards and internal systems  
• Increase online sales with optimized e-commerce platforms  
• Build a strong digital presence that reflects their brand and identity  
• Develop tools that grow with their business and adapt to evolving needs

Whether it’s helping a local brand sell online, a founder ship their MVP, or a creative studio streamline their operations — I focus on delivering clean, practical, and purpose-driven solutions that make an impact.

3. what do you do? and how do you do that

I design and develop tailored digital solutions — from websites, chatbots and dashboards to automated tools — with a strong focus on meeting the unique needs of each user or business. Whether building independently or collaborating with other professionals when needed, my goal is to deliver solutions that are purposeful, simple, and scalable.

I actively leverage open-source technologies and contribute back to the community, believing that great software is built through shared knowledge and continuous learning. Every project I take on is approached with the intent to solve real problems — not just write code — and to create meaningful impact for those I work with.

4. what are my dream companies and who could get me an interview from these companies

My dream companies are those building the tools we use every day — intuitive, developer-friendly platforms that shape the way we work, create, and collaborate. I'm especially drawn to companies like **Notion, Figma, Linear, GitHub, Replit, Vercel, and Cloudflare**, along with the **Linux ecosystem**, where simplicity, open-source values, and high-impact engineering drive everything forward.

I’m equally inspired by **big tech innovators** like **Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Spotify**, where technology scales to billions while still prioritizing good design and developer experience.

On the creative side, I also admire **audio plugin companies** such as **iZotope, FabFilter, and Native Instruments** — not just for their DSP expertise, but for their craftsmanship and attention to UI/UX.

I aim to connect with **engineers, developer advocates, indie builders, and hiring managers** from these companies — people who value clean code, open-source contributions, and a product-first mindset.
