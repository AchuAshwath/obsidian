## Takeaway

Awfully suspicious course which doesn't seem to be prerecorded at all, which is a direct Segway to GrowthSchool's other courses with such a convincing pitch which seems to under promises and over delivers, but the whole session was a summary of bunch of free tools that the internet has which is one search away. But one key takeaway that you can take away from this session in my opinion is that, you can achieve whatever you want through consistent actions which standout apart from the rest, you don't have to know everything and anything to make a difference.
