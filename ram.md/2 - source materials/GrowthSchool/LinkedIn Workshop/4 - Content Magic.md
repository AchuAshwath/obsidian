# Content Magic 

Content is the channel which keeps your audience engaged thus improving your profile.

Example of content viewers 

| Degree | Sum   | Percentage |
| ------ | ----- | ---------- |
| 1st    | 2061  | 13.12%     |
| 2nd    | 12395 | 78.89%     |
| 3rd    | 1256  | 7.99%      |

Only 20% of the engagement comes from either connections or followers. 

2 types of content - content is to increase visibility

1. for/ on your own profile
2. for other's profile

Engage with your target audience content.

There is no formula for creating content, but a structure.

Consistency is the biggest growth hack.

- written post are the best format
- images are the worst because LinkedIn don't push posts with images for some reason, only use it if its absolutely necessary to convey where words can't do that job, or use it if the image is the MVP of the post. for example, posts with showing desk setup does well because there is no other better way to show it through a post, but chances of going viral is slim. 
- videos - it depends - choose videos over written because it builds visual memory, people will relate to you and your content and every time you post they will recall you. 
- carousel or pdf posts - do decently well, so use it instead of images. when you want to communicate in slides or post a presentation.

Written 
1. Stories - people relate to stories
2. Trend Jacking 
3. Case Studies 
4. Voice your opinion

Perfect LinkedIn post structure
