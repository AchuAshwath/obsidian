# Initiating Spring Initializr

Complete the following steps to use Spring Initializr to set up the Family Cash Card REST API application.

1. Open dashboard tab labeled Spring Initializr:
	 - [Spring Initializr][https://start.spring.io/]
2. Select the following options:
	 - Project: Gradle - Groovy
	 - Language: Java
	 - SpringBoot: Choose the latest 3.3.X version
3. Enter the following values next to the corresponding Project Metadata fields:
      - Group: example
      - Artifact: cashcard
      - Name: CashCard
      - Description: CashCard service for Family Cash Cards
      - Packaging: Jar
      - Java: 17

 > Note: You don't have to enter the "Package name" field -- Spring Initializr will fill this in for you!

4. Select the ADD DEPENDENCIES... button from the Dependencies panel.

5. Select the following option, since we know that we'll be creating a web application:
	  - Web options: Spring Web

  Later on in the course, you'll be adding additional dependencies without using Spring Initializr.

6. Click the CREATE button. Spring Initializr generates a zip file of code and unzips it in your home directory.

7. From the command line in the Terminal tab, enter the following commands to use the gradle wrapper to build and test the generated application.

Go to the cashcard directory in the Terminal dashboard tab.
   
  ```bash
[~] $ cd cashcard
[~/cashcard] $
```  
   
Next, run the ./gradlew build command:

```bash
[~/cashcard] $ ./gradlew build
```

The output shows that the application passed the tests and was successfully built.
```bash
~/cashcard] $ ./gradlew build
