# Provisioning

Provisioning is the process of allocating or creating resources and services for a customer. In AWS, provisioning services are responsible for setting up and managing the cloud infrastructure required to run an application. Most of these services use **AWS CloudFormation** under the hood to automate the process.

## Key Provisioning Services

### 1. AWS Elastic Beanstalk (EB)

Elastic Beanstalk is a **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** that makes it easy to deploy and manage web applications without needing deep knowledge of the underlying infrastructure.

- **How it Works:** You simply choose a platform (e.g., Ruby, Node.js, Python, Docker), upload your application code, and Elastic Beanstalk handles the rest.
    
- **Automated Provisioning:** It automatically provisions and manages a collection of AWS services, including:
    
    - EC2 instances
        
    - An Auto Scaling Group (ASG)
        
    - An Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)
        
    - An S3 bucket for storing application versions
        
    - CloudWatch monitoring and alarms
        
- **Best For:** Developers who want to focus on writing code and not on managing infrastructure. It's often compared to services like Heroku. While AWS documentation sometimes suggests it's not for production, it is more than capable for small to medium-sized applications.
    

### 2. AWS OpsWorks

OpsWorks is a configuration management service that provides managed instances of popular open-source tools like **Chef** and **Puppet**. It is used to automate the configuration and deployment of servers and applications.

### 3. AWS CloudFormation

This is the foundational **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** service at AWS.

- **Functionality:** It allows you to model and provision your infrastructure using template files written in JSON or YAML.
    
- **Underlying Engine:** It is the core engine that powers many other provisioning services, including Elastic Beanstalk and Control Tower.
    

### 4. AWS Quick Starts

These are pre-built CloudFormation templates created by AWS and its partners to deploy complex workloads quickly. They serve as reference architectures that can be launched with just a few clicks.

### 5. AWS Marketplace

A digital catalog of thousands of software listings from independent software vendors (ISVs). You can find, buy, and deploy software, often as pre-configured **AMIs** or CloudFormation templates, directly onto your AWS infrastructure.

### 6. Serverless and Container Provisioning

- **AWS Amplify:** A framework and hosting service for building and deploying full-stack web and mobile applications, primarily with a **serverless** backend. It provisions services like AppSync, DynamoDB, and Lambda.
    
- **AWS App Runner:** A fully managed service for quickly deploying containerized web applications and APIs. It handles all infrastructure, from building to load balancing and scaling. It is a PaaS designed specifically for containers.
    
- **AWS Copilot CLI:** A command-line interface that simplifies the process of launching and managing containerized applications on ECS, Fargate, and App Runner.
    

### 7. Other Developer-Focused Tools

- **AWS CodeStar:** Provides a unified UI and pre-configured toolchains (CI/CD pipelines) to help you quickly develop, build, and deploy applications on AWS. It often sets up common stacks like a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) server.
    
- **AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit):** An imperative IaC tool that lets you define your infrastructure using a programming language. It then synthesizes your code into a CloudFormation template for deployment.
