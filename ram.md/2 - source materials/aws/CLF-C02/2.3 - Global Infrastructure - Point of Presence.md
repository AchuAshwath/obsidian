## Point of Presence

Points of Presence (POP) is an intermediate location between an AWS Region and the end user, and this location could be a datacenter or collection of hardware.

For AWS a Point of Presence is a data center owned by AWS or a trusted partner that is utilized by AWS Services related for content delivery or expediated upload.

PoP resources like, 
1. Edge locations - are datacenter that hold cached (copy) on the most popular files so that the delivery of distance to the end users are reduced.
2. Regional Edge Caches - are datacenters that hold much larger caches of less-popular files to reduce a full round trip and also to reduce the cost of transfer fees.

example: S3 Bucket (Your Origin) -> Regional Edge Cache -> Edge Location -> End User.

PoPs live at the edge/intersection of two networks

*Tier 1 Network* is a network that can reach every other network on the Internet **without purchasing IP transit or paying for peering**

AWS availability zones are all redundantly connected to multiple **tier-1 transit providers**

### AWS Servies using PoPs

Some examples using PoP for content delivery or expediated upload.
- *Amazon CloudFront* is a **Content Delivery Network**  that, 
	- you point your website to CloudFront so that it will route the requests to nearest Edge Location cache.
	- allow you to choose an **origin** (such as a web-serve or storage) that will be source of cached.
	- caches that contents of what origin would returned to various Edge Locations around the world
- *Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration* allow you to generate a especial URL that can be used by end users to upload files to a nearby Edge Location.
	- Once a file is uploaded to and Edge Location, it can move much faster within the AWS Network to reach S3.
- *AWS Global Accelerator* can find the optimal path from the end user to your web-serves. Global Accelerator are deployed within Edge Locations so you send user traffic to an Edge Location instead of directly to your web application.
