# Direct Connect

AWS Direct Connect is a private/ dedicated connection between you datacenter, office, co-location and AWS

> Imagine you're having a fibre-optic cable running from a data centre all the way to your AWS, giving next to no latency.

Direct connect has two **very-fast network** connection options: 
1. Lower Bandwidth **50MBps-500MBps**
2. Higher Bandwidth **1GBps or 10GBps**

## Advantages

1. Helps **resuce network costs** and **increase bandwidth throughput** - great for high traffic networks.
2. Provides a **more consistent etwork experience** than a typical internet based connection - reliable and secure.

> A co-location (aka carrier-hotel) is a data-center where equipment, space, and bandwidth are available for rental to retail customers.

Although AWS says [[2.4 - Direct Connect]] is private they are more like dedicated, the connection is private but not necessarily secure, we will discuss about setting up secure direct connect more while we learn VPNs 

## Locations

Direct connect locations are trusted partnered data-centre that you can establish a dedicated high speed, low-latency connection from our on-premise to AWS

For example, A partnered datacenter in Toronto is Allied Data Centres, 250 Front Street West Toronto

> You would use the AWS Direct Connect service to order and establish a connection
