# TCO and Migration

This chapter focuses on the financial and strategic considerations involved in migrating from an on-premise data center to the AWS cloud, including how to estimate costs and plan the migration process.

## Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

TCO is a financial estimate intended to help you determine both the **direct and indirect costs** of a product or service. When considering a cloud migration, TCO is used to compare the full cost of running your infrastructure on-premise versus on AWS.

- **The Iceberg Analogy:** Many people only consider the obvious, "above the surface" costs like hardware and software licenses. TCO forces you to consider the hidden, "below the surface" costs.
    
    - **On-Premise Hidden Costs:** Physical security, cooling, power, IT personnel for maintenance, hardware racking/stacking, etc.
        
    - **AWS Advantage:** With AWS, these hidden costs become AWS's responsibility, allowing you to focus on your applications.
        
- **Migration Costs:** It's important to remember that a migration itself has an initial cost. A Gartner research report showed that while a company saw a 55% reduction in costs over three years, there was an initial spike in spending during the migration phase before the savings were realized.
    

### CAPEX vs. OPEX

Understanding TCO involves a shift in how you account for IT spending, moving from a Capital Expenditure model to an Operational Expenditure model.

- **Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):**
    
    - **Description:** Spending money upfront on physical infrastructure (e.g., servers, storage). This is a one-time purchase that is depreciated over time.
        
    - **Model:** The traditional on-premise model. It requires you to guess your capacity needs in advance.
        
- **Operational Expenditure (OPEX):**
    
    - **Description:** The ongoing cost of running a business (e.g., paying for services, software leases, employee salaries).
        
    - **Model:** The cloud model. You pay as you go for the resources you consume, which eliminates the need for large upfront investments.
        

## Shifting IT Personnel

A common concern during a cloud migration is whether IT personnel will become redundant. The answer is generally no; instead, their roles and responsibilities shift.

- **New Roles:** Traditional IT roles can transition to cloud-focused roles (e.g., a network engineer becomes a cloud network specialist).
    
- **Focus on Value:** By offloading infrastructure management to AWS, IT teams can shift their focus from "managing infrastructure" to "revenue-generating activities" and innovation.
    

## AWS Tools for Cost Estimation and Migration

### AWS Pricing Calculator

A free, web-based tool (calculator.aws) that allows you to estimate the cost of your planned AWS workloads.

- **Functionality:** You can configure over 100 AWS services to get a detailed cost estimate.
    
- **TCO Calculation:** This tool is what you use to determine the "AWS" side of the TCO comparison. You compare the estimate from this calculator against your current on-premise costs.
    

### AWS Migration Evaluator (formerly TSO Logic)

This is a complimentary service that helps you create a data-driven business case for migrating to AWS.

- **How it Works:** It uses an agentless collector to discover your on-premise server configurations, usage, and costs.
    
- **Output:** It provides a detailed assessment of your current on-premise costs, which can then be compared against AWS pricing to calculate TCO and potential savings.
    

### VM Import/Export

A service that enables you to easily import virtual machine (VM) images from your existing environment to Amazon EC2 and export them back to your on-premise environment.

- **Process:** You prepare your VM image, upload it to an S3 bucket, and then use the AWS CLI to import it as an Amazon Machine Image (AMI), which you can then use to launch EC2 instances.
    

### AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)

A service that helps you migrate databases to AWS quickly and securely.

- **Flexibility:** It supports migration between different database types (homogeneous and heterogeneous migrations, e.g., from Oracle to PostgreSQL).
    
- **Schema Conversion Tool (SCT):** DMS is often used with the SCT, which helps convert your source database schema and code to a format compatible with the target database.
    

## AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)

The AWS CAF is a whitepaper and framework that provides guidance and best practices for organizations to plan their cloud migration journey. It breaks down the complex process into six key perspectives or focus areas:

1. **Business:** Ensuring that IT aligns with business needs and that the cloud investment drives business outcomes.
    
2. **People:** Managing the human side of the change, including staff skills, training, and organizational culture.
    
3. **Governance:** Updating the skills and processes needed to ensure proper governance, risk management, and compliance in the cloud.
    
4. **Platform:** Designing and optimizing the cloud architecture and infrastructure.
    
5. **Security:** Ensuring that the cloud architecture meets the organization's security and compliance requirements.
    
6. **Operations:** Updating the processes and skills needed to manage and operate the new cloud environment efficiently and reliably.
