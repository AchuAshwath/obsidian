# EC2 Pricing Models

AWS offers several pricing models for Amazon EC2, allowing you to optimize costs based on your workload's predictability, duration, and tolerance for interruption. The default model is On-Demand, but significant savings can be achieved with other options.

## 1. On-Demand

This is the default, most flexible pricing model.

- **How it Works:** You pay a fixed rate by the hour (or by the second, with a 60-second minimum) with no long-term commitment.
    
- **Billing:** Per-second billing applies to most modern instances (Linux, Windows), while some older types or specific AMIs might be billed per hour.
    
- **Best For:**
    
    - Applications with short-term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads.
        
    - Applications being developed or tested for the first time on AWS.
        
- **Commitment:** None. This is the pay-as-you-go model.
    

## 2. Reserved Instances (RIs)

RIs provide a significant discount (up to 72%) compared to On-Demand pricing in exchange for a commitment to a specific instance family for a one or three-year term.

- **Best For:** Applications with steady-state or predictable usage.
    
- **RI Attributes:** The price of an RI is determined by several attributes:
    
    - **Instance Type:** e.g., t3.large
        
    - **Region:** The AWS region where the RI is purchased.
        
    - **Tenancy:** Shared (default) or Dedicated.
        
    - **Platform:** The operating system (e.g., Linux, Windows).
        

### RI Class Offerings

- **Standard RI:** Offers the highest discount (up to 72%) but is less flexible. You can modify some attributes like AZ and instance size (for Linux).
    
- **Convertible RI:** Offers a lower discount (up to 54%) but allows you to exchange the RI for another with different attributes (e.g., instance family, OS) as long as the new RI is of equal or greater value.
    

### RI Payment Options

- **All Upfront:** You pay for the entire term in one payment, offering the largest discount.
    
- **Partial Upfront:** You pay a portion upfront and are billed the remaining hours at a discounted rate.
    
- **No Upfront:** You pay nothing upfront but commit to paying a discounted hourly rate for the entire term, regardless of usage.
    

### Regional vs. Zonal RIs

- **Regional RI (More Flexible):** The discount applies to any instance usage in any AZ within that region. It provides instance size flexibility (e.g., a discount for a t3.large can apply to two t3.mediums). **It does not reserve capacity.**
    
- **Zonal RI (Reserves Capacity):** The discount applies only to a specific instance type in a specific AZ. **It guarantees that capacity is reserved for you.**
    

### RI Marketplace

The RI Marketplace allows you to sell your unused Standard RIs to other AWS customers to recoup costs if your needs change. Convertible RIs cannot be sold on the marketplace.

## 3. Savings Plans

Savings Plans are a more flexible pricing model that provides discounts similar to RIs. Instead of committing to a specific instance, you commit to a consistent amount of compute usage (measured in $/hour) for a one or three-year term.

- **How it Works:** Any usage up to your commitment is charged at the discounted Savings Plans rate. Any usage beyond your commitment is charged at the regular On-Demand rate.
    
- **Types of Savings Plans:**
    
    - **Compute Savings Plan:** The most flexible option. Provides discounts of up to 66% and automatically applies to EC2 usage regardless of instance family, size, AZ, region, OS, or tenancy. It also applies to **AWS Fargate** and **AWS Lambda** usage.
        
    - **EC2 Instance Savings Plan:** Offers the deepest discount (up to 72%) but requires a commitment to a specific instance family in a specific region (e.g., t3 in us-east-1).
        
    - **SageMaker Savings Plan:** Applies specifically to Amazon SageMaker usage.
        

## 4. Spot Instances

Spot Instances allow you to use spare EC2 computing capacity at a very steep discount (up to 90%) compared to On-Demand prices.

- **How it Works:** The price of Spot Instances is determined by long-term supply and demand.
    
- **Interruption:** AWS can reclaim your Spot Instance with a two-minute warning if they need the capacity back for On-Demand customers.
    
- **Best For:**
    
    - Workloads with flexible start and end times that can handle interruptions.
        
    - Applications that are only feasible at very low compute costs, such as big data analysis, scientific computing, and batch processing.
        

## 5. Dedicated Hosts

While not strictly a pricing model, a Dedicated Host is a physical server with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use.

- **Billing:** You are billed per host. You can use **On-Demand**, **Reserved Instances**, or **Savings Plans** to pay for the host itself, which can significantly reduce costs.
    
- **Use Case:** Primarily for meeting strict compliance requirements or for software licenses that are bound to a specific physical server (BYOL). It is the most expensive tenancy option.
    

## Capacity Reservations

This feature allows you to reserve EC2 capacity for a specific instance type in a specific AZ for any duration.

- **Purpose:** It ensures you can launch instances when you need them, even if there is high demand.
    
- **Billing:** You are charged the On-Demand rate for the reserved capacity, whether you run an instance in it or not. You can combine this with Regional RIs or Savings Plans to get a discount.
