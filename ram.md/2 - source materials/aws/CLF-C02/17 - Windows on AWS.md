# Windows on AWS

AWS provides extensive support for running Microsoft Windows workloads, offering a wide range of services and tools to make it easy to migrate, manage, and modernize Windows-based applications on the cloud.

## Core Services for Windows Workloads

### Windows Server on Amazon EC2

You can launch EC2 instances with various versions of Windows Server, including the latest releases.

- **Free Tier:** AWS offers a Free Tier eligible Windows Server AMI, which is notable as it's not a common offering on other cloud platforms.
    
- **RDP Access:** You connect to a Windows instance using the **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)**. To do this, you must download the RDP file from the AWS console and decrypt the administrator password using the private key from the key pair you generated at launch.
    

### SQL Server on Amazon RDS

AWS provides fully managed support for Microsoft SQL Server through its Relational Database Service (RDS). This simplifies the setup, operation, and scaling of SQL Server databases.

### AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory

This is a managed service that allows you to run Microsoft Active Directory (AD) on AWS. It enables you to use your existing AD identities to access AWS resources and applications.

### Amazon FSx for Windows File Server

A fully managed, scalable file storage service built for Windows. It provides a native Windows file system that can be accessed over the **SMB (Server Message Block)** protocol, making it ideal for applications that rely on shared file storage.

## Tools for Windows Developers and Administrators

- **AWS SDK for .NET:** A dedicated Software Development Kit (SDK) that allows developers to interact with AWS services using the .NET framework, a popular choice for Windows development.
    
- **AWS Tools for PowerShell:** Enables administrators and developers to manage their AWS resources from the PowerShell command line, a standard in the Windows ecosystem.
    
- **AWS Lambda with PowerShell:** You can write your serverless Lambda functions using PowerShell, providing a familiar scripting environment for Windows administrators.
    

## Licensing and Migration

### AWS License Manager

This service makes it easier to manage your software licenses from vendors like Microsoft, IBM, SAP, and Oracle.

- **Bring Your Own License (BYOL):** License Manager helps you track and enforce the rules of your existing licenses when you migrate them to AWS.
    
- **Dedicated Hosts:** For many BYOL scenarios, especially with Microsoft licenses, you may be required to use **EC2 Dedicated Hosts** to comply with licensing terms that are bound to physical hardware.
    

### Migration Acceleration Program (MAP) for Windows

MAP is a structured methodology provided by AWS to help large enterprises migrate their Windows workloads to the cloud. AWS also has a network of partners who specialize in providing professional services for MAP projects.

## Windows on the Desktop

### Amazon Workspaces

This is a secure, managed virtual desktop service. It allows you to provision either Windows or Linux desktops in the cloud, which users can access from anywhere. It's an ideal solution for remote work and providing secure, consistent workstations for employees.
