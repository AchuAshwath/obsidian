# Local Zones

local zones are Data Centers located very close to a densely populated areas to provide singled digit millisecond low latency performance like 7ms (for that area)

To use a local Zone you do need to opt in.
you have to go talk to AWS probably open a support ticket to get access to it

It looks just like a an Availability Zone it's going to show up under certain regions ,that is because these are always tied to existing regions

- Los Angeles, California was the first Local Zone to be deployed 
	- Its a logical extension of the US-West Region
	- The identifier looks like **us-west-2-lax-1a**
- Only specific AWS servies have been made available
	- EC2 Instance types - T3, c%, R5, R5d, I3en, G4
	- EBS (io1 and gp2)
	- Amazon FSx
	- Application Load Balancer
	- Amazon VPC

The purpose of Local Zone is to **support hightly-demanding applications sensitive to latencies**,
- Media & Entertainment
- Electronic Design Automation
- Ad-Teach
- Machine Learning

# Wavelength Zones 

AWS Wavelength Zones allows for **edge-computing on 5G Networks**.

Applications will have ultra-low latency beign as close as possible to the users

AWS has partnered with varios Telecom companies to utilise their 5G networks such as verizon, vodofone, KDDI, SK telecom.

**How it works?**

You create a Subnet tied to a wavelength zone and then you can launch virtual machines to the edge of the targeted 5G networks.
