# Global Infrastructure 

The AWS Global Infrastructure is the physical foundation of the entire AWS cloud. It's a massive, worldwide network of data centers and hardware that provides the reliability, low latency, and global reach that make AWS so powerful. Understanding its components is fundamental to making correct architectural decisions.

The infrastructure is built on a hierarchy:  
**Global Network -> Regions -> Availability Zones -> Data Centers**

---

### Core Components: Regions and Availability Zones

#### 1. Regions

A **Region** is a distinct geographical area in the world, like North Virginia (us-east-1) or Ireland (eu-west-1). Each region is a separate geographic area.

- **Isolation:** Regions are designed to be completely isolated from each other. A failure in one region (e.g., due to a natural disaster) will not impact other regions.
    
- **Composition:** Each Region consists of multiple, isolated **Availability Zones**. Most regions have at least three AZs to ensure high availability.
    
- **Service & Data Locality:** When you launch a regional service like an EC2 instance, you choose a region. Your data and the service itself will reside within that geographic area unless you choose to replicate it elsewhere.
    

**Key Takeaway: Choosing a Region**  
You must select a region based on four key factors:

1. **Compliance & Data Residency:** Some laws require data to be stored in a specific country.
    
2. **Latency:** To provide the best experience for your users, choose the region physically closest to them.
    
3. **Service Availability:** The newest AWS services are often released in the us-east-1 (N. Virginia) region first before being rolled out to others.
    
4. **Cost:** The price of AWS services can vary slightly between regions.
    

#### 2. Availability Zones (AZs)

An **Availability Zone (AZ)** is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity within a Region.

- **Physical Separation:** AZs are physically separate from each other within a region (by many kilometers) to protect against localized disasters like fires or floods.
    
- **Logical Connection:** They are connected with high-bandwidth, low-latency private fiber-optic networking (<10ms), allowing for fast, synchronous data replication between them.
    
- **High Availability:** The concept of running an application across multiple AZs is the cornerstone of building highly available and fault-tolerant systems on AWS. If one AZ fails, your application can continue to run in the others.
    
- **Subnets:** In practice, you don't launch a resource directly into an AZ. You launch it into a **subnet**, which is tied to a specific AZ.
    

#### 3. Fault Tolerance

The relationship between Regions and AZs is the foundation of AWS's fault tolerance.

- An **AWS Region** can be considered a **Fault Level** (a collection of fault domains).
    
- An **Availability Zone (AZ)** can be considered a **Fault Domain** (an isolated unit that can fail independently).
    

> "Each Amazon region is designed to be completely isolated from the other Amazon regions... Each availability zone is also isolated... designed as an independent failure Zone."

### Edge Networking and Content Delivery

#### The AWS Global Network

This is the private, high-speed fiber-optic network that interconnects all of AWS's data centers and edge locations. Think of it as AWS's own private internet backbone, designed for performance and security.

#### Points of Presence (PoPs)

A PoP is an intermediate location between an AWS Region and your end-users. In AWS, this primarily refers to **Edge Locations** and **Regional Edge Caches**.

- **Edge Locations:** A worldwide network of data centers that Amazon CloudFront (AWS's CDN) uses to cache content closer to users, dramatically reducing latency.
    
- **Regional Edge Caches:** A mid-tier caching layer between Edge Locations and your origin server. They hold larger caches of less-frequently accessed content.

### Hybrid, Edge, and Specialized Infrastructure

These services extend the reach of AWS beyond its standard regions, either into your own data centers or to the very edge of the network.

- **AWS Direct Connect:** A dedicated, private fiber connection from your on-premise data center directly to AWS. It offers a consistent, high-bandwidth connection that bypasses the public internet.
    
    - **Key Distinction:** It is private but not inherently encrypted. For end-to-end security, it's often used with a VPN.
        
- **AWS Outposts:** A service that provides a physical rack of AWS-managed servers that you can install in your own data center. This is for a truly consistent hybrid cloud experience, allowing you to run AWS services on-premise.
    
- **AWS Local Zones:** Small-scale extensions of an AWS Region located in major metropolitan areas. They provide very low-latency compute and storage for applications like media production and real-time gaming.
    
- **AWS Wavelength Zones:** Embeds AWS compute and storage services within the 5G networks of telecommunication providers. This is designed for building ultra-low-latency applications for mobile devices.

### Data Residency and Governance

#### Data Residency & Sovereignty

This refers to the legal and regulatory requirements that dictate where data must be physically stored. AWS provides specialized regions to help customers meet these strict compliance needs.

#### Specialized Regions

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Region Type|Description|Key Requirement / Feature|
|**GovCloud (US)**|Isolated regions designed for U.S. government agencies and contractors to host sensitive controlled information.|Operated by U.S. citizens on U.S. soil. Complies with **FedRAMP** and other government standards.|
|**AWS in China**|Isolated regions to comply with Chinese regulations. These are operated in partnership with local Chinese companies.|Requires a Chinese business license (**ICP license**) to use. It is a completely separate partition from the global AWS cloud.|

### Other Global Services

- **AWS Ground Station:** A fully managed service that provides a global network of antenna ground stations, allowing you to communicate with satellites and process satellite data.
    
- **Sustainability:** AWS is committed to running its global infrastructure on 100% renewable energy. This commitment is part of "The Climate Pledge" and focuses on energy efficiency and water stewardship in their data centers.
