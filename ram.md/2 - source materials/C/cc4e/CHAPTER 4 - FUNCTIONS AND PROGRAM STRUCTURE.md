# CHAPTER 4 - FUNCTIONS AND PROGRAM STRUCTURE

Functions break large computing tasks into smaller ones, and enable people to build on what others have done instead of starting over from scratch. Appropriate functions can often hide details of operation from parts of the program that don't need to know about them, thus clarifying the whole, and easing the pain of making changes.

C has been designed to make functions efficient and easy to use; C programs generally consist of numerous small functions rather than a few big ones. 
 - A program *may reside on one or more source files* in any convenient way; 
 - the source files may be *compiled separately and loaded together*, 
 - along with *previously compiled functions* from **libraries**.
