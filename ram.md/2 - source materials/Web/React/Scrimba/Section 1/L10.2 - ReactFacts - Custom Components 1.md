# Custom Components Part 1: Introduction to Functional Components

This lesson marks a crucial step in building maintainable React applications by moving from stuffing all JSX into `root.render()` to creating reusable **Custom Components**.

## The Power of Reusability with Functions

The core idea behind React components is reusability, a concept fundamentally enabled by **functions** in programming.

  * **Functions' Purpose:** Functions encapsulate reusable blocks of code. They can take parameters (inputs) and can be called repeatedly to perform a task without rewriting the same logic.
  * **React Components as Functions:** In React, a custom component is essentially a JavaScript function that returns JSX (which represents your UI).

## Creating a Basic Custom Component

Let's refactor the "ReactFacts" project's main markup into a component.

**Initial State (all markup in `root.render`):**

```javascript
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"))

root.render(
  <main>
    <img src="/src/assets/react.svg" width = "80px" alt="React" />
    <h1>Fun Facts about React</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Was first released in 2013</li>
      <li>Was originally created by Jordan Walke</li>
      <li>Has well over 100K stars on GitHub</li>
      <li>Is maintained by Facebook</li>
      <li>Powers thousands of enterprise apps, including mobile apps</li>
    </ul>
  </main>
)
```

**Step 1: Encapsulate JSX in a Function (Initial Attempt)**

We can start by putting the JSX inside a regular JavaScript function and then calling that function in `root.render()`.

```javascript
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

// Define a function that returns the JSX
function temporaryName() { // Using a regular function name for now
    // Return the JSX.
    // Wrap in parentheses if the JSX starts on a new line for readability.
  return(
   <main>
    <img src="/src/assets/react.svg" width = "80px" alt="React" />
    <h1>Fun Facts about React</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Was first released in 2013</li>
      <li>Was originally created by Jordan Walke</li>
      <li>Has well over 100K stars on GitHub</li>
      <li>Is maintained by Facebook</li>
      <li>Powers thousands of enterprise apps, including mobile apps</li>
    </ul>
  </main>   
  )
}

const container = document.getElementById('root');
const root = createRoot(container);

// Call the function
root.render(
	temporaryName()
); // This *works* but is not the React convention
```

  * **Note on Parentheses after `return`:** If your JSX starts on the same line as `return`, you don't need parentheses. However, for multi-line JSX (which is very common), it's a best practice to wrap it in parentheses to avoid automatic semicolon insertion issues and improve readability.

## React Conventions for Custom Components

While calling a function directly works, React has specific conventions for rendering custom components that are crucial for clarity, tool compatibility, and future features.

### Rule 1: PascalCase Naming Convention

  * **Requirement:** Custom React components **must** start with an **uppercase letter**. This is known as **PascalCase**.
  * **Why?** React distinguishes between native HTML elements (e.g., `<div>`, `<h1>`) and custom components (e.g., `<MyComponent>`, `<Header>`) based on their capitalization. If a component starts with a lowercase letter, React will treat it as a standard HTML tag, leading to errors.

### Rule 2: Render as a JSX Tag

  * **Requirement:** Instead of calling the component function like a regular JavaScript function (`temporaryName()`), you render it as if it were a custom HTML element using JSX tags.

      * **Self-Closing:** For components that don't need to wrap other content (like our `MainContent` from a previous example or if our `temporaryName` component encapsulates everything), use a self-closing tag: `<TemporaryName />`.
      * **Opening/Closing Tags:** For components that *do* need to wrap other content (which we'll explore more in Part 2), use opening and closing tags: `<MyComponent></MyComponent>`.

**Refactored Example (Adhering to React Conventions):**

```javascript
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

// Renamed to PascalCase: App
function App() {
    return (
        <main>
            <img src="react-logo.png" width="40px" alt="React Logo" />
            <h1>Fun facts about React</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Was first released in 2013</li>
                {/* ... more list items */}
            </ul>
        </main>
    );
}

const container = document.getElementById('root');
const root = createRoot(container);

// Render using JSX tag syntax (self-closing in this case)
root.render(<App />);
```

## Challenge: Create a `Page` Component

**Goal:**

1.  Create a new custom component named `Page`.
2.  Inside `Page`, return an **ordered list (`<ol>`)** with at least two reasons why you're excited to learn React.
3.  Render this `Page` component to the DOM.

```javascript
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

// Define the new Page component
function Page() {
    return (
        <ol>
            <li>React is a popular library, so I'll fit in with all the coolest devs out there.</li>
            <li>I'm more likely to get a job as a front-end developer if I know React.</li>
        </ol>
    );
}

const container = document.getElementById('root');
const root = createRoot(container);

// Render the Page component
root.render(<Page />);
```

### Self-Closing vs. Paired Tags for Components

As observed in the challenge, a component can be rendered in two ways:

1.  **Self-closing tag:** `<MyComponent />`
      * Used when the component doesn't enclose any children within its tags. This is the most common form for atomic components.
2.  **Paired opening and closing tags:** `<MyComponent></MyComponent>`
      * Used when the component needs to wrap and render other JSX or text content as its `children`. This will be explored more in upcoming lessons (e.g., when passing children via `props`).

For the majority of this course, you will primarily use the self-closing component syntax.

-----

**Self-Assessment:** Before moving on, consider deleting all your code and trying to recreate the entire setup (importing `createRoot`, defining `App` and `Page` components, and rendering them) from memory. This active recall is an excellent way to solidify your understanding.
