# Custom Components Quiz

This quiz provides a quick check of your understanding of React components.

## Question 1: What is a React component?

**Answer:**

A React component is simply a **JavaScript function that returns React elements (or JSX, which represents React elements).**

**Elaboration:**

  * **Function:** It's a standard JavaScript function (often an arrow function or a traditional function declaration).
  * **Returns React Elements:** When a component is called (or rendered), it executes and returns a description of the UI in the form of React elements. These are JavaScript objects created by `React.createElement()` calls (which JSX transpiles into).
  * **User Interface (UI):** Fundamentally, a React component is a reusable piece of your application's user interface.

## Question 2: What is wrong with the code that we see here?

```javascript
// Example Code (Implicitly provided via context - likely a function named `myComponent`)
function myComponent() {
    return <h1>Hello</h1>;
}
```

**Answer:**

The name of the component, `myComponent`, is incorrect. In React, custom components **must be named using PascalCase** (e.g., `MyComponent`).

**Correction:**

```javascript
function MyComponent() { // First letter capitalized
    return <h1>Hello</h1>;
}
```

**Explanation:**

  * React differentiates between native HTML elements (e.g., `<div>`, `<span>`) and custom React components based on their capitalization.
  * If a component starts with a lowercase letter, React will treat it as a standard HTML element, which will lead to errors because no such HTML element is defined.

## Question 3: What is wrong with the code that you see here?

```javascript
// Example Code (Implicitly provided via context - likely how a component is rendered)
root.render(header()); // Assuming 'header' is a PascalCased component function
```

**Answer:**

The way the component `header()` is being rendered is incorrect. It's being called like a regular JavaScript function, but React components should be rendered as **JSX tags**.

**Correction:**

```javascript
// Assuming 'Header' is the correctly PascalCased component
root.render(<Header />);
```

**Explanation:**

  * While calling the function directly *might* technically work in some limited scenarios (because it returns the React element object), it bypasses React's internal processes and conventions.
  * Rendering a component as a JSX tag (`<Header />`) signals to React that you want to create an *instance* of that component and manage its lifecycle, props, and other React-specific behaviors.
  * This JSX syntax for components is how React expects them to be used for proper reconciliation and efficient DOM updates.

This quiz concludes the initial dive into fundamental React components. The next steps will explore how to further compose components and manage their relationships.
