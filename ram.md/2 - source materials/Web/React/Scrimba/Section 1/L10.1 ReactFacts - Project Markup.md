# ReactFacts Project: Initial Markup

This lesson focuses on setting up the initial static markup for the "ReactFacts" project, practicing foundational React concepts.
## Challenge: Render the ReactFacts Markup

**Goal:** Recreate the basic structure of the ReactFacts main content within your React application.

**Hints:**

- Start from scratch (re-do `createRoot` and `root.render`).
- Remember the "one parent element" rule.
- For the image source, use `react-logo.png` if in Scrimba; locally, you might need an absolute path (`/react-logo.png` or `/src/assets/react-logo.png`).
- Set the image `width` property to `40px` directly in the JSX for now.
- Don't forget the `alt` attribute for accessibility.

**Desired Structure:**

```html
<main>
    <img src="react-logo.png" width="40px" alt="React Logo" />
    <h1>Fun facts about React</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Was first released in 2013</li>
        <li>Was originally created by Jordan Walke</li>
        <li>Has well over 100K stars on GitHub</li>
        <li>Is maintained by Facebook</li>
        <li>Powers thousands of enterprise apps, including mobile apps</li>
    </ul>
</main>
```

### Solution

```jsx
// index.jsx

import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

// Get the root DOM node
const container = document.getElementById('root');
const root = createRoot(container);

// Render the main content structure
root.render(
    <main>
        {/* Image element with source and width */}
        <img src="/src/assests/react.svg" width="80px" alt="React Logo" />

        {/* Heading */}
        <h1>Fun facts about React</h1>

        {/* Unordered list with list items */}
        <ul>
            <li>Was first released in 2013</li>
            <li>Was originally created by Jordan Walke</li>
            <li>Has well over 100K stars on GitHub</li>
            <li>Is maintained by Facebook</li>
            <li>Powers thousands of enterprise apps, including mobile apps</li>
        </ul>
    </main>
);
```


## Key Takeaways from the Challenge & Setup:

1. **Setting up the Root (`createRoot` and `render`):**
    - `import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';` is essential for modern React (React 18+).
    - `createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))` establishes the entry point for your React application in the DOM.
    - `root.render(<YourComponent />)` tells React what to render inside that root.
       
2. **The "One Parent Element" Rule (Recap):**
    - You **must** wrap multiple sibling JSX elements within a single parent element.
    - Common parent elements include `div`, `main`, `section`, `article`, etc.
    - Choosing a [semantic HTML element](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element%23content_sectioning) (like `<main>`) is often better for accessibility and structure than a generic `<div>`.
       
3. **Handling Images (Temporary Method):**
    - For now, we're directly using `src` attributes with relative paths for static images.
    - The `width` attribute can be used directly on the `<img>` tag in JSX, just like in HTML, to control its size before applying CSS classes.
    - Always include an `alt` attribute for accessibility.
    - **Reminder:** A more robust method for handling static assets in Vite/React will be introduced later.
     
4. **Current Project Structure Limitation:**
    
    - Currently, all the UI markup is "stuffed" directly inside `root.render()`.
    - This approach is not scalable or maintainable for larger applications.
    - **Next Step:** The course will transition to using **Custom Components** to organize and modularize the UI, providing much greater flexibility and a better structure.
