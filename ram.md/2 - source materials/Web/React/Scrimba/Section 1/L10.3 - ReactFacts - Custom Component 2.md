# Custom Components Part 2: Structuring a Multi-Element Page

This challenge builds upon the previous lesson by having you create a more complex page structure using a single React component, emphasizing the "one parent element" rule.

## Challenge: Build a Complete Page Component

**Goal:** Enhance your `Page` component to include a header, main content (with your existing ordered list and a new heading), and a footer.

**Specific Tasks:**

1.  **Add a `header` element:**
      * It should be the *first* element returned from your `Page` component.
      * Inside the `header`, include an `<img>` element.
          * `src`: `"react-logo.png"` (or the appropriate absolute path for your local setup).
          * `width`: `"40px"`.
          * `alt`: `"React Logo"`.
2.  **Add a `main` element:**
      * This element should wrap both your existing ordered list (`<ol>`) and a new `<h1>`.
      * The `<h1>` should come *before* the ordered list.
      * `<h1>` text: "Reasons I'm excited to learn React".
3.  **Add a `footer` element:**
      * This should be the *last* element returned from your `Page` component.
      * Inside the `footer`, include a `<small>` tag with text like: "© 2024 Your\_Last\_Name development. All rights reserved." (Update the year and last name as appropriate).

**Key Reminder:** Remember the "one parent element" rule for your `Page` component's return.

```javascript
// index.jsx (or wherever your Page component is defined)

import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

// Define the Page component
function Page() {
    return (
        // Start with a single parent wrapper for the entire page
        // A <div> is used here as a general container, but consider other semantic options.
        <div>
            {/* 1. Header Section */}
            <header>
                <img src="react-logo.png" width="40px" alt="React Logo" />
            </header>

            {/* 2. Main Content Section */}
            <main>
                <h1>Reasons I'm excited to learn React</h1>
                <ol>
                    <li>React is a popular library, so I'll fit in with all the coolest devs out there.</li>
                    <li>I'm more likely to get a job as a front-end developer if I know React.</li>
                </ol>
            </main>

            {/* 3. Footer Section */}
            <footer>
                <small>© 2024 Scrimba development. All rights reserved.</small>
            </footer>
        </div>
    );
}

// Render the Page component (assuming `root` is created as in previous examples)
const container = document.getElementById('root');
const root = createRoot(container);
root.render(<Page />);
```

## Important Takeaways and Common Pitfalls:

1.  **The Persistent "One Parent Element" Rule:**

      * The most common immediate challenge when adding multiple sections (like `header`, `main`, `footer`) to a component is violating the "one parent element" rule.
      * You cannot directly return multiple top-level sibling elements from a component's `return` statement.
      * **Solution:** Always wrap them in a single parent element. A `<div>` is a common temporary solution, but strive for semantic wrappers like `<section>`, `<article>`, or even a `<Fragment>` (discussed next) when no meaningful semantic container exists.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```javascript
    // ❌ INCORRECT - Will cause an error!
    function MyComponent() {
        return (
            <header>...</header>
            <main>...</main>
            <footer>...</footer>
        );
    }
    ```

    ```javascript
    // ✅ CORRECT
    function MyComponent() {
        return (
            <div> {/* This single div wraps everything */}
                <header>...</header>
                <main>...</main>
                <footer>...</footer>
            </div>
        );
    }
    ```

2.  **Semantic HTML for Structure:**

      * Using elements like `header`, `main`, `footer`, `section`, `article`, etc., improves the readability of your code and, more importantly, enhances **accessibility** for users relying on assistive technologies.
      * It's a good habit to choose the most semantically appropriate HTML tag for your content.

3.  **Direct Attributes vs. CSS:**

      * You can use attributes like `width` directly on HTML elements in JSX (e.g., `<img width="40px" />`).
      * While convenient for quick styling, this is generally less maintainable than using external CSS classes. The course will introduce proper CSS styling methods soon.

4.  **Current State of Composability:**

      * Even with this improved structure, we still have one very large `Page` component.
      * This isn't yet fully leveraging React's composability, where smaller, specialized components (e.g., a `Header` component, a `MainContent` component, a `Footer` component) would make the application more modular and easier to manage.
      * The next steps in the course will focus on breaking down this large component into smaller, more composable units.

**Self-Reflection:** If this challenge was difficult, it's a good indicator to revisit the "one parent element" rule and practice creating simple functional components that return structured JSX. Repetition builds muscle memory and understanding.
