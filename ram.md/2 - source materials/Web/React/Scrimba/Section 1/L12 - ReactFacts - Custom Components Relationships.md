# Custom Components: Parent/Child Relationships

This lesson demonstrates how to break down a large, monolithic component into smaller, more manageable and reusable child components. This is a core aspect of React's composability.

## The Problem with Large Components

While a single `Page` component can hold all markup for a small page, it quickly becomes unmanageable and less readable for larger applications. Even a seemingly small "three-line" header can grow significantly in a real-world scenario (user interactions, data fetching, etc.).

  * **Readability:** A single, very long component is hard to read and understand.
  * **Maintainability:** Changes in one part might inadvertently affect another unrelated part.
  * **Reusability:** A monolithic component is difficult to reuse in different contexts.
  * **Composability:** You lose the benefits of building complex UIs from simple, independent blocks.

## Challenge: Extract Header Component

**Goal:** Take the `header` element and its content from the `Page` component and move it into its own dedicated `Header` component. Then, render the `Header` component in place of the original `header` JSX within `Page`.

**Steps:**

1.  **Define a new functional component named `Header`** (remember PascalCase\!).
2.  **Move the `<header>` JSX (including the `<img>` tag) into the `return` statement of the `Header` component.**
3.  **In the `Page` component, replace the original `<header>` JSX with a `<Header />` self-closing tag.**


```javascript
// index.jsx

import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

// 1. Define the Header component
function Header() {
    return (
        <header>
            <img src="react-logo.png" width="40px" alt="React Logo" />
        </header>
    );
}

// Existing Page component (will be modified)
function Page() {
    return (
        <> {/* Using a Fragment as the wrapper */}
            {/* Replace the original <header> JSX with the Header component */}
            <Header /> {/* This is the instance of your Header component */}
            <main>
                <h1>Reasons I'm excited to learn React</h1>
                <ol>
                    <li>React is a popular library, so I'll fit in with all the coolest devs out there.</li>
                    <li>I'm more likely to get a job as a front-end developer if I know React.</li>
                </ol>
            </main>
            <footer>

            </footer>
        </>
    );
}

const container = document.getElementById('root');
const root = createRoot(container);
root.render(<Page />);
```

## Challenge: Extract MainContent and Footer Components

**Goal:** Continue the refactoring process by moving the `main` element into a `MainContent` component and the `footer` element into a `Footer` component. Then, render these new components within the `Page` component.

**Steps:**

1.  **Define a new functional component named `MainContent`.**
2.  **Move the `<main>` JSX (including its `<h1>` and `<ol>`) into the `return` statement of `MainContent`.**
3.  **Define a new functional component named `Footer`.**
4.  **Move the `<footer>` JSX (including its `<small>` tag) into the `return` statement of `Footer`.**
5.  **In the `Page` component, replace the original `<main>` and `<footer>` JSX with `<MainContent />` and `<Footer />` tags, respectively.**

```javascript

import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

// Header Component
function Header() {
    return (
        <header>
            <img src="react-logo.png" width="40px" alt="React Logo" />
        </header>
    );
}

// MainContent Component
function MainContent() {
    return (
        <main>
            <h1>Reasons I'm excited to learn React</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>React is a popular library, so I'll fit in with all the coolest devs out there.</li>
                <li>I'm more likely to get a job as a front-end developer if I know React.</li>
            </ol>
        </main>
    );
}

// Footer Component
function Footer() {
    return (
        <footer>
            <small>© 2024 Scrimba development. All rights reserved.</small>
        </footer>
    );
}

// The main Page component now orchestrates the smaller components
function Page() {
    return (
        <>
            <Header />
            <MainContent />
            <Footer />
        </>
    );
}

const container = document.getElementById('root');
const root = createRoot(container);
root.render(<Page />);
```

## Understanding Parent and Child Components

With this refactoring, we've established a **component hierarchy**:

  * **Parent Component:** The component that *renders* other components.
      * In our example, `Page` is the parent component.
  * **Child Component:** The components that are *rendered by* a parent component.
      * `Header`, `MainContent`, and `Footer` are child components of `Page`.

**Diagrammatic Representation:**

```
          root.render()
                |
              <Page />  (Parent)
              /   |   \
             /    |    \
    <Header /> <MainContent /> <Footer />  (Children)
```

**Benefits of this Hierarchy:**

  * **Modularity:** Each component is responsible for a specific part of the UI, making it easier to understand and debug.
  * **Reusability:** `Header`, `MainContent`, and `Footer` can potentially be reused in other parts of the application or even in different projects.
  * **Organization:** Code is neatly compartmentalized, improving project structure.
  * **Collaboration:** Different developers can work on different components simultaneously with less conflict.

While this example might seem "overkill" for such a small page, it perfectly illustrates the foundational principle of composability that scales to very large and complex React applications. This pattern of breaking down UI into a tree of components is fundamental to building with React.
