# ReactFacts Navbar & Styling

This lesson focuses on implementing the visual design of the navigation bar for the ReactFacts project, requiring a blend of React component structure and CSS styling. It also serves as a point to decide whether to get a CSS refresher or skip ahead.

## CSS Styling in React Projects (Decision Point)

The course will involve several sections of CSS-heavy challenges to mimic the provided design.

  * **Recommendation:** If you're new to CSS, haven't mimicked a design from Figma/etc. before, or need a refresher, **do these CSS challenges.** It's crucial practical experience for front-end development.
  * **Permission to Skip (Hesitantly):** If you are already very proficient in CSS and design implementation, you *may* skip the detailed CSS portions of these challenges.

## Challenge: Complete the Navbar Styling

**Goal:** Style the `Navbar` component to match the Figma design (screenshot provided in the lesson).

**Hints & Requirements:**

  * **Semantic HTML:** The `Navbar` component should return a `<header>` as its top-level element. Inside the `<header>`, there should be a `<nav>` element.
  * **Content:** Inside the `<nav>`, render the React logo image (`react-logo.png`) and a `<span>` element with the text "ReactFacts".
  * **Styling:** Reference the Figma design for exact colors, font sizes, weights, and spacing.
      * You can use **element selectors** in `index.css` for simplicity in this small project, but remember that using `className` in JSX and corresponding class selectors in CSS is generally preferred for larger applications.

### Navbar Component Structure :

```javascript
// components/Navbar.jsx
import React from 'react';

export default function Navbar() {
    return (
        <header>
            <nav>
					<img src="/src/assets/react.svg" alt="React" />	
                <span>ReactApp</span>
            </nav>
        </header>
    );
}
```

**`index.css`:**

```css
body{
  margin : 0;
  font-family: Inter;
}
header{
  height: 90px;
  background-color: #212121;
  padding: 30px 25px;
}
nav {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100%;
}
nav > img{
  width: 80px; /* Adjust the width as needed */
  margin-right: 7px;
}
nav > span {
  font-size: 1.4em;
  color: #ffffff;
  margin-left: 7px;
  color: #61DAFB;
  font-weight: 700;
}
```

## Key Learnings from Navbar Styling:

1.  **Semantic HTML in Components:** It's good practice to use semantic HTML5 tags (`<header>`, `<nav>`) within your React components where appropriate, even when creating separate components for them. This aids accessibility and SEO.
2.  **CSS and React Interplay:**
      * You continue to write plain CSS in your `.css` files.
      * You apply these styles using the `className` attribute in your JSX.
      * For simple projects with clear, unique elements (like a single navbar, a single main content section), using direct element selectors (e.g., `header nav img`) can sometimes be acceptable for brevity, but relying on class names is generally more robust and scalable.
3.  **Flexbox for Layout:** Flexbox is incredibly useful for common layout patterns like:
      * Aligning items horizontally (`display: flex`, `justify-content`).
      * Vertically centering items (`align-items: center`).
      * Distributing space (`justify-content: space-between`).
4.  **Google Fonts Integration:** Ensure your font `<link>` tags are placed in the `head` of `index.html` *before* your main stylesheet to ensure they load and prevent FOUT (Flash of Unstyled Text). You then reference the font in your CSS using `font-family`.
5.  **Pathing for Images (Scrimba vs. Local):** Be mindful that relative paths for images (`../react-logo.png`) might work differently depending on your local development setup (e.g., Vite) versus a hosted environment like Scrimba. Absolute paths or dedicated asset imports will be covered later for a more universal solution.

This challenge helps solidify your understanding of how React components structure the content, while CSS handles the visual presentation. The next steps will apply similar styling techniques to the main content section.
