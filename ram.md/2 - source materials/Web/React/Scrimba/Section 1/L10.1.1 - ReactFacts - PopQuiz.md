# Pop Quiz: Fundamental React Concepts

This quiz serves as a self-assessment to reinforce core concepts covered so far before moving on to custom components.

## Question 1: Where does React put all of the elements I create in JSX when I call `root.render()`?

**Answer:**

React places all the elements rendered via `root.render()` inside the specific DOM node that was selected when `createRoot()` was called. In our examples, this is typically the `div` with the `id` of `root` in the `index.html` file.

**Explanation:**

  * When you do `const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'))`, you are explicitly telling React: "Manage everything inside *this* particular HTML element."
  * All JSX (which compiles down to React elements) that you pass to `root.render()` will be injected as children of that designated root DOM node.
  * You can verify this by inspecting the DOM in your browser's developer tools.

## Question 2: What would show up in my console if I were to run this line of code: `console.log(<h1>Hello World</h1>)`?

**Answer:**

Running `console.log(<h1>Hello World</h1>)` would output a **plain JavaScript object**.

**Explanation:**

  * JSX is **not** raw HTML. It's a syntax extension that gets transpiled (converted) into `React.createElement()` calls.
  * The `React.createElement()` function, when executed, returns a regular JavaScript object. This object describes the element (its type, props, children) in a format that React understands for building its internal Virtual DOM.
  * It is *not* an actual DOM node directly, but a representation of one that React uses to reconcile changes and efficiently update the browser's DOM.

## Question 3: What is wrong with this code?

```javascript
// Assuming root is already created and imported
root.render(
    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <p>I am a paragraph.</p>
);
```

**Answer:**

The error in this code is that you are trying to render **multiple sibling JSX elements without a single parent wrapper element.**

**Correction:**

To fix this, you need to wrap the sibling elements (`<h1>` and `<p>`) inside a single parent container. This parent can be a semantic HTML element (like `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`) or a generic `<div>`.

```javascript
// âœ… Corrected Code
root.render(
    <section> {/* Or <main>, <section>, etc. */}
        <h1>Hello!</h1>
        <p>I am a paragraph.</p>
    </section>
);
```

**Explanation:**

  * React's `render` method expects a single top-level element (or component) to be passed to it.
  * This rule is a direct consequence of how JSX compiles down to `React.createElement()`, which expects a single element description at its top level.
  * The parent element acts as a single point of entry for React to manage the subtree of elements.

## Question 4: What does it mean for something to be declarative instead of imperative?

**Answer:**

  * **Imperative:** You tell the computer **how** to do something, providing a precise, step-by-step sequence of instructions. (e.g., "Create an H1, set its text, add a class, then append it to the root.")
  * **Declarative:** You tell the computer **what** you want to achieve, describing the desired outcome or state. The library/framework then handles the underlying "how-to" steps. (e.g., "Render an H1 with this text and this class.")

**Analogy:**

  * **Imperative:** Giving someone extremely detailed, step-by-step instructions on how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich (e.g., "Pick up the knife. Open the peanut butter jar...").
  * **Declarative:** Simply asking someone, "Please make me a peanut butter and jelly sandwich," trusting them to know the process.

**Relevance to React:**

React is declarative because you write JSX to *describe* the UI you want to see, and React takes care of all the complex DOM manipulation behind the scenes to make it happen. HTML itself is also a declarative language.

## Question 5: What does it mean for something to be composable?

**Answer:**

For something to be **composable** in web development means that larger sections of an application can be broken down into smaller, independent, and flexible pieces that can be reused and combined in various ways to build more complex systems.

**Analogy:**

  * **Composable (Lego Bricks):** Small, individual Lego bricks can be combined in infinite ways to create larger, intricate structures. Each brick is reusable.
  * **Non-Composable (Sculpted Statue):** A statue carved from a single block of stone is a monolithic unit; it cannot be easily broken down and its parts reused elsewhere.

**Relevance to React:**

React's core concept of **components** directly embodies composability. You build small, self-contained components (like a button, a navbar, or a specific card), and then combine these components to build an entire application. This promotes code reuse, reduces redundancy, and makes applications easier to manage and scale.
