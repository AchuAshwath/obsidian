# Introduction to React Course

Bob zero is one of the most popular react instructors in the world and he's back again with this completely updated react for beginners course this course is the perfect starting place for anyone learning react you'll learn the **basics of modern react and build a bunch of fun projects** 

hey free code campers and welcome to this introduction to react course my name is Bob zero and I am super excited to be here guiding you through the wonderful world of learning react I have been working for the last 6 months to make this the most interactive react course out there in fact throughout this course you you are going to be working on over 170 challenges and building six larger projects

let's look at those six projects 
1. React Facts site - Static
2. Travel Journal - Data Driven
3. Chef Claude - State
4. Meme Generator - Side Effects
5. Tenzies Game - Capstone 1
6. Assembly : End Game - Capstone 2

I've mentioned how interactive the course is going to be you might be asking what's the best way to follow along well you really have two options you could stay here on YouTube and continue to follow the course doing the challenges and projects in your own editor on your own machine or you can hop over to scrimba and do the challenges over there either one is completely fine with me as long as you're doing those challenges and building the projects because 

Something I like to tell all of my students is that the easiest way to learn something new is to actually do it the hard way, this means that instead of just coasting on by hoping that you're retaining the information you actually put in the work and the time and effort that it takes to learn that new thing practice practice, practice is extremely important and I'm going to be up on this soap box reminding you about this many times throughout the course I think that the best way to do this is to have a bit of a paradigm shift and remember that you are not being graded on this course be curious it doesn't matter if you make mistakes you can always undo the changes that you've made and try again 

#### More about projects

The first two projects focus on building static web pages in react allowing us to dip our toes into the syntax of react and then starting to transition into using reusable components which is one of the fundamental things that we learn in react. 
 
In sections three and four of the course we're going to be transitioning away from just static web pages into web applications that are much more interactive with the user, and to do that we'll be building two really awesome web applications one is called Chef Claude where the user can input a list of ingredients send that off to an artificial intelligence engine to give you a recipe that you can use with those ingredients and a meme generator where you can input the top text, bottom text and change.

We got two Capstone projects that we'll be working on the first one is a dice game called Tenzies and the second one is called assembly end game it's basically a hangman Style game where the user tries to guess a secret word so 
## About

This is the ideal starting point for anyone eager to learn modern React basics in the most interactive, hands-on way possible. Throughout this course, you'll tackle over 170 interactive coding challenges and build six exciting projects. If you're tired of React courses that leave you staring blankly at an empty editor screen, you're in the right place! Here, you'll actually build React projects by the end, giving you the confidence and skills to tackle real-world applications.

### Section 1: Static pages (project: ReactFacts site)

In this introductory section, you'll get familiar with React basics, including components, JSX, and styling. You’ll create a simple ReactFacts site, learning about composable and declarative code, React elements, and best practices for building static pages in React.

#### Topics covered:

- Intro to React
- Why React?: Composable & Declarative
- React Elements
- JSX
- Creating custom components
- Fragments
- Styling with Classes

### Section 2: Data-Driven React (project: Travel Journal)

Next, you’ll discover how to make your React apps dynamic by introducing reusable components, props, and data-driven rendering. In the inspiring Travel Journal project, you’ll map data to components, handle static assets, and use props to personalize the user experience.

#### Topics covered:

- Reusable components
- Props
- Evaluating JS inside JSX
- Handling static assets
- Mapping data to components

### Section 3: React State (project: Chef Claude)

This module introduces you to React's state management, allowing you to handle events, manage complex state, and create responsive forms. The Chef Claude project will help you see the difference between props and state, implement conditional rendering, and dynamically style components based on user interaction.

#### Topics covered:

- Event listeners
- Props vs. State
- Creating & changing state
- Complex state
- Forms & form actions
- Conditional rendering
- Setting state from children
- Dynamic styles

### Section 4: Side effects (project: Meme Generator)

Explore side effects in React with this module on data fetching, controlled components, and refs. In the Meme Generator project, you’ll practice managing side effects, optimizing dependencies, and cleaning up resources, giving you a robust foundation for handling external data and effects.

#### Topics covered:

- Controlled components/forms
- Functional programming in React
- Fetching data Handling side effects
- Side effect dependencies
- Cleaning up side effects
- Refs

### Section 5: Capstone project 1: Tenzies game

This capstone project challenges you to put everything you've learned into action by building a complete Tenzies game. Through step-by-step challenges, you'll improve your skills by learning lazy state initialization and accessibility, creating a polished, interactive experience.

#### Topics covered:

- Series of challenges to build the capstone project
- Lazy state initialization
- Accessibility improvements

### Section 6: Capstone project 2: Assembly: Endgame

In this final capstone, you'll face a series of challenges to build a complex, multi-featured app. By the end of Assembly: Endgame, you’ll have gained real-world experience in problem-solving and combining all the React skills you've developed throughout the course.

#### Topics covered:

- Series of challenges to build the capstone project

### Why this course?

This course is filled with coding challenges that you'll complete by writing React code directly inside the browser! Before you know it, you'll have written six interactive React applications!

You’ll also benefit from spaced learning and repetition in this course. Make sure you give yourself time (days/weeks) to finish it, and include lots of breaks. Don't try cramming it all in at once.

Once you are done, you will feel confident in your React skills and be ready to continue your coding journey.
