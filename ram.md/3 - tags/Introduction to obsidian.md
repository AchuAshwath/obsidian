#### Indexes
Indexes are bigger tags essentially, when certain tags are referenced in abundance then an Index would be a collective topic of that tags with subtopics which serve as a Index.

### Templates
 - setup hotkeys for templates in the settings.
 - I use ctrl+alt+I - to insert template.

### Tagging
1. avoid being vague
2. avoid being too specific
3. meet in the middle
4. will I ever use the tag again?
5. personalize your tags - your system

### Note taking
1. keep it short(ish) - try to make it fit in one page
2. tackle one idea at a time
