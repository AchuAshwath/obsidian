# Saturday 11-22

You are getting started.
yes sir i think i should be like
Yo.
Yo, Sean.
Can you pitch in here?
What?
Is it recording?
Yeah, it's recording.
Can we start?
Yeah, it started long back.
Then what the fuck are you doing?
Right?
Yeah.
What the fuck are you doing?
Throw some balls, man.
Yo.
Yeah?
Yeah, come on.
See.
We have two things, right?
Yeah.
We'll have to repeat the idea so the... The recording goes on.
So I think we have to... One, we are gonna focus on two.
One, gonna be the photographers themselves.
Who's gonna upload all the photos, you know, and then based on the events and something like that.
We're going for marriage because we have to start somewhere.
Yeah.
Let's just say it's events.
So it could be like when we come into our use case, that is weddings.
It could be pre-wedding photoshoot, wedding photoshoot.
And I know what else.
Mehendi.
And all of these things.
So these are all events of one project.
Okay, so that's why I have project slash events.
So we can give the, you know, photographer to name one project, get a startup project and then create events within them, schedule, you know, these things, what do we call it?
schedule like this is when we are you know going to take the photoshoot and everything.
They schedule through the app.
Yeah like you know like users can get into the phone and then ask for this photographer and a photographer can send them I invite link so he can set up his project here and then send them a link so they can download that
But the whole vetting, the whole vetting history, vetting, host vetting, all that comes under one project, right?
Or does it not?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Superb D now, he'll create a, you know, a project.
He'll create a project and then he'll list, so based on their project they have three events.
So pre-voting,
pre- wedding photo shoot and then that is wedding photo shoot and then post wedding photo shoot.
So he'll schedule all of these based on they'll talk more.
It's not always confirmed right?
It's not always confirmed.
We can give templates for them.
Okay, they can set templates up like this and all features inside.
We don't go for example.
Okay, the whole idea is like he'll create this project and then send them a link.
Okay.
And he can put dates when they can expect their photos, all of these things.
Why he sets this up?
Okay, we can also edit it.
If he edits it, you know, it's like, due to this reason, you know, like you might get after two days.
Yeah, I will get you, I will get you.
So, first time is like pre wedding photoshoots after pre wedding photoshoot after 2 weeks.
So, let us say today they are taking pre wedding photoshoot.
So, within 2 weeks you will get your photos that is what time is promising.
So, he can say like this is the time pre wedding photoshoot we will do and then this is the time you can expect your photos.
everything is available in the app so he'll just you know like share this link this link this link to the customer the customer will open the link it's an app so they can go into their like they can see my projects that they are in
So I will pre-order it when they can extract the photos.
So here we can have another thing.
So we can push them notifications.
For X, X is the photographer for now.
X has enrolled you into this project.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So you can, like, like, once we, you know, once one or two photos are ready, they can upload it.
New photos have arrived.
Again, photo notification goes to the user.
Okay, wow.
So something like that.
So the end user in the phone goes into their phone and then gets photos
Like the photographer can do it bulk or small, small chunks at a time.
It's totally up to them.
But the user always gets notified.
Whenever there's a change, any form of thing.
So it's like the communication what usually happens.
The communication happens through WhatsApp or calls and all these things.
We'll just take over that.
Just take over that.
And then like they can, even though call them and say like this is the reason.
Like this has happened.
But they would follow it.
They have a good idea.
So let's suppose it's pre-written.
They have posted like 1000 photos with their 5000 photos.
And they have only posted 1000.
And everyone has set up their app and they have also added their face in the app.
Pre-wedding photoshoot, since we are having a wedding photoshoot, that wouldn't be a good idea.
Let's say it's a wedding night photoshoot.
When there was a wedding, I don't think so.
We are at the point where we are talking about Facebook and that sort of thing.
But I am going to be very posting of what we can do is, we can now give the option for the photographer to notify everyone.
if I add a thousand photos and also like if suppose check out there are more photos of you yeah if the person if there's a person who has logged into their phone like suppose it's me if there's a photo in that new thousand photos that the photographer is uploading it will notify me like that can be an option
that photographer can just check yeah yeah yeah that's what push notifications so whatever he's doing on his dashboard right he can push those notifications to the users so essentially if 5000 photos la the photographer is thinking I can't you know do a certain do 5000 right now I'll break it into two parts 2500 now I'll edit all of them and upload edit all of them huh
Yeah, I'll be a team of course.
He'll edit a bunch.
I'm giving an example number.
He'll sit for a week and edit 2500 of them.
They'll pick how much they will edit.
But they'll touch up every single photos.
They'll put based on the camera settings that they have for a whole session or lighting.
that lighting they will have one specific setting setup and then they will be taking photos with the same setting for little while.
After that they will change based on this like light is present in that area.
If the stretch of photos have the same settings, they can use a preset.
So it's like figuring out one or two photos and then putting everything in the same thing and then slightly changing the brightness or exposure or something like that to make the details pop.
Yeah, they have software so that so we don't have to worry about that thing right now the thing is like they'll edit a bunch of those they can upload it once or they can you know like upload a thousand now and then push notifications to the users saying that new photos have arrived go check them out
And after a week, they can still push new photos of their friends and everybody like group photos where they are helping, individual photos where they are helping.
So you can get all of them.
So whenever he is uploading new thing regarding the wedding, the users who are you have enrolled for that event, they can go and see.
So and another thing also,
The photographers can sit and share links of which event.
So, if you have entered only the wedding.
But the user wants to give for like I am the customer.
I am having the wedding.
I talk to the photographer and photographers manage only this.
But my close friend.
he wants to see, I want to show him the pre-wetting photoshoot.
So what I can do or I want to send to my relatives, I can create a link for a subset of photos that I choose and then the photographer can make it available for them, for the user.
So that they can... Guest link.
Yeah, guest link for
not what they have enrolled.
So, if they use that link yeah, if they use that link they can others other relatives and members can look at that particular photo.
So, particular set of photos yeah.
So, it is like we are just only managing which array of
photos and metadata should be made public for external member who is authenticated via a link.
So, if they click at link this user who is not end-all is end-all to another project, another event of the same project.
But with the limited number of customers, that sounds good.
way way like what what we can if the we don't have to you know like we can say the photographer is the host okay wow and the person who's paying has the owner the owner can see everything what the photographer is you know hosting yeah
We have to upload everything he uploads.
The owner owns it, can see it, delete it, put on comments on it.
All of these things.
The photographer is created you know in event this event or folder Let's just call it a folder or an event anything so essentially I will in my mind event is something that will encapsulate a bunch of photos that the both host and the owner can collaboratively see take a look at and then share their
comments like I can go into my phone when I'm like you know after a pre-wetting photoshoot I'm like sitting
I'll go, the photographer has uploaded the pre-wedding photoshoot.
I go, I can see into this.
And then I can say, okay, I want you to edit these more.
I like these more.
You can super like them or some shit like that.
And you can tell, I will select these photos.
I want you to make them ready for social media.
Okay.
So he'll make that special edit.
and then he'll again give it back so that they can just come into a single app again and again throughout the whole event and then get all things done at one single place so that's the whole idea so this is just for the L1 to know
We have to also discuss regarding how the albums are made.
So we can actually simplify the process.
I think that is our time for the next phase of the discussion.
Let's go to the previous discussion.
So we don't forget.
Which one?
Album generation.
Automatically it will generate the... It will find out the best images in the
all it events through the super lights and lights and the number of views with analytics.
I think the user, the owner, gets to pick exactly not based on likes.
We can give a recommendation.
But for occasions like wedding,
They will pick their own.
But other events, when we are thinking about other events, if someone is, let's say, a LinkedIn event or a GitHub event or an Amazon event, a bunch of people are there.
They sign up.
They will eventually share.
They'll have the ability to go and like their own photos.
Okay, wow.
But we can also have a face wreck on the wedding.
Like the face recognition part.
Mostly... See, I have this thing, okay.
I have this idea.
Now we're talking about face wreck.
How we face it?
No, no, no.
I am not going into face wreck right now.
I'm talking about a thing that is going to be in between face wreck and no face wreck.
The thing is, a perfect example for face recognition is wedding because people just come in, they are not really part of that event.
They don't want other photos of the wedding.
They can ask if they want other photos of the wedding and if the owner permits, gives the link or adds them into another
thing, they can see other photos as well.
But for events like this LinkedIn or GitHub or something like that, get together.
People would like to see other things as well if they have missed it or it's just all about themselves because face recognition removes the other photos that they are not part in.
You just notify them of their... So for example, if you know... I don't know, like based on the context of who that person is, we should be able to give them the right photos.
Not too much and not too less.
But it shouldn't be like managed by someone.
That's the point here.
Like the photographers is supposed to like boom dump everything in a place and the user will say like I am this X person and we are supposed to give them only X amount of access to them based on the owner's willingness to care.
We have to figure out who sees what
but the owner will say like okay this kind of okay this kind of okay like the user will create their own buckets say that this can be seen by these these kind of persons and this can be seen by these kind of persons because if there is a you know meeting okay there are like
you know event on LinkedIn so there are business guys and then there are programmers and other you know coffee makers so like the event you you know you tag yourself in a certain way while you upload yourself for Facebook so that you get into XY recommendations in your photos
What do you mean?
So if there is like a lot of business persons like they face recognize themselves, right?
Obviously and they they'll be like I am business.
So what happens is the software developer can look other software developers in the same way.
Do we do we go there?
Should we go like that?
Because we can also like for example this same this goes to the wedding as well because if you say like I am from the Mopula side groom side or I'm from the bride side like you you should be able to see some of the groom's other relatives as well.
So it's not just you get... I don't know if I got it right.
So what you're trying to say is
The owner picks what, which photo everyone can see.
No, the owner sends your photo to you.
Okay, wow.
Okay.
Sends your photo to you and then the owner will say like, okay, there are these kinds of consumers.
I want these kinds of consumers to consume my photos.
What does that mean?
So for example,
You know, I'm conducting this meeting.
Okay, well, that is a business meeting.
Both, for example, you know, my friends.
I want only my friends to be seeing my friends' photos.
So my school friends, I want my school friends to look at who are all the other schoolmates who attended my wedding.
And we'll all have the same pictures.
It's like sharing it in a group chat.
Instead of based on a single group, you go and share it.
Without that, you just get it in the app.
But the user is not sitting and saying, this is my this friend, this is my this friend.
He needs to get this.
Owner doesn't do that.
While we are taking a selfie and adding their information.
while the project set is being set by the photographer, the owner can set certain tags which the user when they face like themselves would able to answer like a survey like what's your name who are you to the owner and then that creates metadata for us which we can just group into
And also we can also make a way for the owner to select like 50 images of the waiting.
Common.
Yeah, that also happens.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So it's like a more personalized sharing.
But you don't do a lot of work.
The work is already going to be done.
That's my take.
So if there's like a business people,
they would like to know who are all the other business people that have attended this meeting, you know who came before me, who came after me or you know something happened like events like such as dance I wanted to see some dance so like what are you interested in like what's your name who are you and then what you're interested in about their meeting so that you can view that if you get the access you can view those images as well so I want to see how the dance photos I want to see the music performance photos
So that if I, you know, take on this drop downs, I'll be able to view them once they are uploaded.
I'll get the notification.
So saying that this event, these photos that you are interested on, come check it out.
Yeah, that's cool.
So it's like one place you can have multiple photographers using our platform.
and if you go multiple events you get all your events photos in one place and then we'll also emphasize quality too it depends on the subscription model because if we are going to do blazingly fast and high res images then the subscription would be higher but it depends we can for like low level starting photographers we can have a different
and for some enterprise level photographers who are like making a lot of money we can give them like if they promise you know like raw photos to the users and as well as the owners through cloud they can go into a bigger subscription.
What is Memzo?
Memzo is it like candle?
No this is like see the thing here is like Memzo connects photographers
to the end user.
But we are trying to connect photographer, owner and user.
We are more like big to be like.
We are connecting, see the photographers are being hired.
The photographers don't get a say in what the output should be like.
any kind of businessman or event managing so this really works when it's proposed into an event manager so event manager has okay even manager can buy the subscription not the photographers even manager can buy he can set up accounts for you know photographers and then he can he can have the even even manager can have four photographers
and he can give subscriptions to four photographers.
All this event is in the same cloud, same platform.
Every single event he does, he can manage it in one dashboard.
So that also unlocks.
We can provide insights as well.
If everything comes into, if all the data comes in.
So like everything
boil downs to simple thing such as permissions user what kind of user they are what permissions do they have based on their roles we can give them permissions so basically if you narrow you know boil down user can have different roles and different accesses so they're like a super user that is like
Maybe we can use it for an enterprise subscription where that's like the event manager has giving access to, you know, like he's going to do this event, right?
He's the brand.
The photographer is not the brand.
Okay, wow.
So when an event manager is the brand, then he has all the control because he is the owner.
Okay, wow.
When photographer is the brand,
The user who hires the photographer is the owner.
Yeah.
Makes sense.
So yeah.
So if you are going that way, so it's really evident that we need two things.
We need a web dashboard and then a mobile app.
This is an overview usage example.
Are we making sense?
Do we agree on that?
Yeah, that makes sense.
Totally makes sense.
We are also using face recognition.
So now we'll pop into face recognition.
OK, we have established that.
There is a web dashboard for both managing multiple events by the videographer or even manager.
And there is owners and users.
So these are all kind of the roles right now so far I'm thinking of, we'll add one or two maybe, not so sure.
So these are the roles and that is a web dashboard where the photograph anybody, any of the role can access in the web through based on their login or you know that is the end user focused mobile app.
which is like not, doesn't have the dashboard of the thing but has some relevance of it.
Where does it have?
Actually I think the mobile should have those things as well because if the photographer is like it would be nice like I take some photos in mobile or something like that he would be able to
We didn't talk about that.
Yeah, this is now I just got a new idea.
It's like, you should be able to just within friends.
Okay, wow.
I'm going out with my friends.
A trip.
Let's say I take all of my photos in my iPhone and then I just put it in this and then boom.
So we can have a free tear as well.
Yeah, try it out.
Yeah, so it's like... We can do one thing.
If somebody comes in through a wedding, they can try out the free tear.
And then if they like it, they can have a shared subscription.
Like you don't have to buy subscription for just you.
No, no, no subscription would make a lot of complications because the way memes are standing is 1.5 rupees for one photo.
No, that could be a problem.
Why?
Because when he has a lot of photos, he'll be like, oh no.
Like, how will you build?
You will waste all the photos because it's hard.
No.
Once you get all the photos,
They say in Memzol what they say 2 years of storage.
When will you get your photo paid?
I think that's 1.5 rupees per photo a month.
Or else what?
How long you are going to keep it for 2 years?
For 2 years you are going to get 1.5 rupees for a photo.
1.5 rupees for a photo is a lot.
You think about it.
For an average person, if they go on a trip, they'll click 1000 photos.
They don't want to pay 1000 rupees.
It's for a month.
No, no, no.
Like, how long ever he wants to have that photos in his cloud.
He doesn't want to spend 1000 to have it for 6 months.
I would rather pay 100 rupees for 6 months.
No, like how we are going to use AWS or any other cloud services.
that we want to play our builds through the monthly.
So it's like easier for us if we have a similar kind of thing.
We don't have to get every single photo for that person.
It's like whoever is hosting, they can split with their friends.
Dude, see.
view me, our friends are all going through it.
They all want all photos shared all the time.
That makes sense.
Single place, single app, all photos, segregated on events.
Whenever they upload, they can just create a new event and then upload inside a project.
All these things, segregated based on the metadata that
It's letting to upload or the Android phone uploads.
We can also have location information and other information which can be used further for segregation and organization.
The photos are organized on the cloud and in a single place.
Every time you go out
you can have these much photos.
So it's like for just like you know how Google is giving 10 GB storage for free.
We can give them X amount for free and one that gets passed that they'll get into a subscription tier.
We are mostly making our money from who is, you know, is in a subscription.
Okay.
I don't know if this will work out, but we can even start, we can even not have a free time as well.
And start with just subscription, but make it absurdly cheap.
Like 59 rupees or 100 rupees for one or two GB.
We'll discuss on the price in the data.
Yeah, we'll discuss on the price.
We'll have to see the data.
No, no, no.
We'll forget about the data.
We'll look into all the prices.
Yeah, that's what I mean.
Yeah, we'll look at all the prices.
Cloud storage prices.
How 4K photos will impact, how only timing to improve?
Because most of the cases like GitHub events and all, they wouldn't care to have 4K photos.
It will be 1080p or sound to DNF.
It depends on the photographer who is uploading.
We don't have to care.
They can pick a subscription based on that or if it's like in digital photos, yeah, we'll have to see.
The photographer gets the subscription.
But when it comes to other users, like normal data user, that should be a feature.
I think it's better to go with native.
why because like you will have the same architecture like if you if you are you know getting into a page that page will be on both in web okay wow web to go same architecture you don't have to write a different set of programs where to means your meaning react yeah yeah yeah why you think the like
you are creating one page in web.
If you are going with Next.js or React, Next.js is React essentially.
React, it's like components and the logic behind is also JavaScript.
React native backend is also again JavaScript.
So you can have the same backend and then same components like you can
The architecture is the same behind both.
The architecture is different.
Page-wise, if you go into Flutter, it's totally different.
It takes more time to migrate the code from web to Flutter.
But if it's going to be native, you can copy and ask GP to do
Convert into native.
Flutter, it's like different.
Like the fire structure is different.
It takes more time for us to develop.
Yeah, but it's like maintaining two steps.
Yeah, that's there.
But it's like what happens?
Facebook is using React Native.
Facebook is lying.
WhatsApp isn't React Native.
Instagram isn't React Native.
Facebook.
Facebook app, you say?
Yeah.
You're saying Facebook app is using React Native?
I think so.
It doesn't work.
They say it and they, what they do is they have like one small portion using React Native.
The stall is built with a different framework and internal tools.
No, no, no, no.
See, we are using, if you look at that, Netflix is fully blacked by Java only.
All of their back end is Java.
Java, Java, Java.
But they're front end.
We are like, it's about why I wanted to use native because it's all about the push notifications.
It's a react native.
like for it should be native for the android or the ios right?
see when you go into flutter it's kind of shit for faster hattas yes sir what's hattas?
flutter it's kind of shit why why would you say that it's not shit flutter is awesome okay i'm biased to flutter because i know it will have no no i'm talking about the trend of the technology it's like
Even Theo Joe says React Native is lying of their ass.
They have this showcase website.
See, I'm showing it.
They say these are labs that use React Native, but he does it deep dive.
And it's like, no, none of these apps use it.
Like, it even has Alibaba somewhere, and Alibaba has their own fucking framework.
Dude, some company just publicly announced they are going fully into React Native.
Which company?
That was like this Theo video.
Go check it out.
Re-act-native Theo.
Go into Re-act-native Theo.
That's why I'm telling you.
The truth about Re-act-native.
This shocked me.
Regret Re-act-native.
The new architecture.
The new architecture.
Re-act-native.
The new architecture.
Re-act-native.
The new architecture.
Re-act-native.
I don't know.
Yeah, we rebuilt everything.
We need to use.
Okay, there's actually two things we have to discuss on this.
If you go for react meter, there's something called expo, there's something on react meter.
Expo is like the modern way to build apps and expo what it does is it has like an emulator that runs on cloud.
Okay.
And expo
Like, I think if we go... Someone said expo.
Can we go to IEOS?
My friend, yeah, fuck!
My friend, he was telling me expo doesn't work with IEOS.
See, my point here is... If we develop... We are a small team.
Yeah.
We are not scalable yet.
So I think we shouldn't like jumble.
It's really important that we, you know, deploy into production with maximum variety.
Like everybody should be able to join into this.
Okay, why not?
That makes us more enticing.
See, if my friend with iPhone
and another friend with android is not able to you know have a similar set of experience and that experience for us to provide if it takes twice the amount of work that we need to do then that's fucked up because we already have less time in our hands to make this product converting react gs into react metal is faster than converting react gs into front metal yeah why
See.
In terms of finishing development or in terms of scaling the app?
In terms of scaling the app.
Because you need to have two teams.
Even if it's ReactJS and React Native, there's going to be two teams.
No, but they can be intercompatible with each other.
It's not.
First, we have to go into React Native.
And then you have to believe that it's mostly react.
No, it's not.
See, I took an interview.
I told them I worked on react.
And I was like, react means it was totally different, you know?
It's like Kotlin and Java, dude.
No, it's not.
It's not.
OK, ask.
Yeah.
Because I remember this.
I think she should stop it.
Let it go.
Why?
No, it's not about, it will get out of the context.
The transcript will be really, really big.
