# Vision

So this is the whole vision of the project.
So let me start from starting point that we are trying to solve and go to the end goal that we're trying to achieve or the possible direction that this project could go.
So the first one we're trying to solve the problem is
is focusing on the photographers.
They take photos of events and then wedding or something like that and then they obviously store all of these data such as videos and photos into
SD cards, hard drives and so on and then they share these photos and videos to their clients through hard drives as well.
So in order for, from the perspective of the photographers, in order for them to, you know, like, you know, store these photos and videos are through only possible of hard drives.
and then again in order for them to share with their clients is also that is a need for
hard drives.
So that is one of the main pain points that we are trying to address because storing photos, videos or any time of data in hard drives, if they are trying to buy cheaper drives and stuff like that, it could lead on data corruptions when there is a lengthened period of file transfer or anything related to it.
In all the potential
risks that come along with handling hardware.
for such a special occasion, something like wedding and etc.
So the main thing that we are trying to establish through this project is the awareness of cloud storage and cloud storage capabilities to the photographers which would potentially reduce their fatigue in all the other works rather than maintaining
other works, which would reduce the other works that the photographers have to do just by getting into the cloud platform.
We are not just trying to create a solution with only cloud.
One of the parts is cloud storage where the photographers and even managers can upload their
all of their media into cloud which would be securely be available for them to grab whenever they want and they can also freeze these photos and videos into our chips if they are not being used for a very long time but still if they need it sometime or another it would be really useful for them to have a
cloud based retrieval and then combining when we when we have something in the cloud and the internet combining that to for the delivery system is going to be really really easy so that's the next part of the whole project that we have set up so initially
addressing the pain point on hardware related storage on to the photographers we integrate cloud for them and then we give them ability to upload photos into the cloud and manage their photos and manage photos and videos and all the media related files for their clients and providing clients access to this cloud
so that the clients can have access to all of their special moments from anywhere.
That is the key concept here.
after that when it comes to you know photo delivery system for example in a wedding photos needs to be delivered to all the persons who attend the photo the wedding that is quite essential and a cumbersome process that's going to be happening once the wedding is done and you know reducing the fatigue of both photographers and the clients is where the feature of
you know AI based photo delivery system comes in.
So, what essentially this feature is all about is once you know the event starts the wedding event starts for example, we go in we scan and we scan and join into a specific event that the photographer needs to be host can can host ok.
So if the photographer can host an event and if people come to that event, they can join that event through a QR code scan and upload their selfie of their face so that it's used to do face recognition and deliver all the photos of them.
to the person who have joined the event.
So that is one of the features that we are also trying to implement over this platform or the project as well.
So if you look again at the overview, the pain points of the photographers are hardware and then storing the media files, which is addressed through cloud and then we have again
The pain point of the customers of the photographers, which is the clients and the users, they get their photos without any problem at all.
The clients don't have to go through and select every single photo, go through every single photo and send the photos to their relatives or friends or whomever it may be.
it is being taken care of.
So, this is the whole general you know initial goal of the project.
So, to address this and then deliver product through this.
So, this product if we take in account has all the fundamental
foundational assets and components that will be built on top of to our end goal.
So now I would talk about the end goal that I am trying to achieve.
We are trying to achieve through this project.
So, the end goal is pretty generic and comprises of a large user scale that if you take in account of the current scenario of
photo sharing or video sharing platforms.
I don't think so that probably exists a viable solution like Swiggy or Zomato.
So that's what we are trying to bridge.
For example, let me just take an example of people going for a trip.
So I have my friends and we are all going on a trip.
and I have an iPhone and my friend has an Android and another friend has an iPhone and we take a lot of photos and videos and it's a trip that's going to be a lot of media that's going to be generated and once all of these media is generated I have to again you know send all of those photos to my friend who is in the friend who has iPhone I can you know you know I drop it and sometimes these I drops also don't work very real very nice
if the storage is too big and if I want to share it in WhatsApp again you know that is a compression and then that is you know file limitations for the documents
And then it's just not as intuitive and smooth of an experience.
Multiple platforms, multiple messaging apps like Telegram, WhatsApp, and Google Drive.
Google Drive is also something we have to do.
So if we are going into the Google Drive and Google Drive has a free tier, I have to put it on.
And then once the photos are there and once my
you know, storage gets full, I have to go and delete those things.
And again, when the photos are deleted, I can't go back and get them.
So that is also a thing.
So looking all of this, addressing this is also the end goal.
So the end goal is like a photo sharing app where people can create events and then our groups or whatever we can call it.
So it's like a which has an invitation link or a QR code or whatever it may be
And then people join to a specific event and that event people can take photos in their camera or photos in their phone and instantly get uploaded into cloud so that all of their photos and videos are present in the cloud and it's actually being shared to the specific persons who have joined that event.
And while joining this event when going into the
you know even management or the photographers point of view we can add you know permissions, accessibility roles, personal branding and so much so and a lot of these things as well which will be discussed further in the feature comparison document but I don't want to really go deep into that.
This document and this is fully talking about what the
the whole vision of this project is.
So the whole vision of this project is to build app, you know, the end call is to build like a really good app that encompasses a free tire for storage where people can have their photos there and then
different subscription tires so the next subscription would be you know an individual or a group so if you buy it for a group that group has you know it's like a shared one subscription so it's like people can you know just share all the you know storage within that particular app so we people can invite people can join different events
And then people can, you know, this app or a platform is going to be essentially, you know, the one place where videos, photos and media is going to be getting shared.
That's the whole point of this platform.
So if you think we start our journey with, you know, trying to solve the problem of photographers, which builds, which lets us build, you know, the foundational things such as, you know, configuring the cloud, databases and the features such as, you know, uploading, reading, viewing, writing and then
all of these things and from that we will slowly transition into the end goal in such a way that you know when we finish the first phase which is the photographers wedding kind of phase what will happen is we would have certain number of you know clients using this and then the clients customers which are users users going to be having the apps installed and
in the future will be releasing smaller updates to this app which would let them you know add photos of that particular event from the photos they have taken into this thing.
To the event so that can also possibly happen so it's like a combination of you know Going from one place to the starting place to the end goal in you know like a series of You know features and updates that we are going to be rolling out So that is the whole vision of this project I would like to reiterate again in order to make it you know seem more obvious and
So we start with addressing the problems of photographers and event managers and create a solution which is a mobile app and a web interface app where people can go where photographers can go into the website and also do all the operations and which these operations are also can be done through the app as well.
So both
And once this you know feature is like said and done we will slowly release out into the users adding features more and more such as tagging AI faced AI faced recognition based photo delivery and then
And then more features that would be getting updated into this thing.
But I want to summarize this whole thing, this whole document to have the overall vision of this project.
