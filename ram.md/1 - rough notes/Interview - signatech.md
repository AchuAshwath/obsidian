```WhatsApp
I have acknowledged the receipt of the mail offer for the role of Data and AI Engineer from Shilpa. I am enthusiastic about the prospect of contributing to your team.
Before I formally accept the offer, I would appreciate it if you could provide some additional details in a formal offer letter or mail. This would help me in making an informed decision and ensure a smooth onboarding process.
Specifically, I would like to request clarification and documentation on the following:
    • Detailed Salary Breakdown: A comprehensive breakdown of the fixed annual compensation (Rs. 7,00,000/-), including components such as basic, HRA, special allowances, etc.
    • Variable Pay Performance Criteria: Clear and specific criteria or metrics for the performance-based variable pay (Rs. 1,00,000/-), so I understand how it will be calculated and disbursed.
    • Package Re-evaluation and Bonuses: Documentation or a clause in the offer letter explicitly mentioning the re-evaluation of my package after three months and the details regarding potential bonuses, as discussed during the interview process.
    • Job Responsibilities: A brief overview or a detailed job description outlining the key responsibilities and expectations for the Data and AI Engineer role.
    • Terms and Condition : Important clauses like probation period, notice period, confidentiality agreements, and other company policies.

Having these details in the formal offer letter would be greatly beneficial. 
I will officially request these through mail tomorrow, before that I wanted to let you know.

Hi Ashwath,

Thank you for your follow-up and thoughtful questions. Please find my responses below to help you get better clarity on the offer and next steps:

1. Salary Structure Breakdown
    The offer letter reflects the total fixed compensation of ₹7,00,000/- per annum, in line with our standard offer process.
    Salary components such as Basic, HRA, Special Allowance, etc., are finalized at the time of payroll processing and reflected in your first salary slip.
    However, an approximate breakup can be shared during your discussion with Shilpa, for your reference.

2. Variable Pay Criteria (₹1,00,000/-)
    The performance criteria for the variable component will be mutually agreed upon within the first two weeks of your joining.
    This is because a clear understanding of your responsibilities and deliverables is essential before defining measurable KPIs.
    Your offer letter will mention this explicitly — I encourage you to trust the process we’ve put in place.

3. Compensation Re-evaluation & Bonus
    Your offer includes a 3-month probationary period, post which performance will be reviewed, and your compensation re-evaluated accordingly.  This may not change the fixed part of the salary we may increase the variable I am adding this as you negotiated
    While we don’t commit specific figures in the offer letter, bonuses are linked to your contributions across secondary and billable projects and are decided during the annual performance cycle.

4. Role and Responsibilities
    As shared in our final interview, this Data and AI Engineer role is being created specifically for you based on your capabilities.
    You will be working across Full Stack, Data, and AI initiatives, and over the first 90 days, we’ll jointly assess where your strengths align best.
    I recommend we move ahead without delay, especially since we have an AI Enablement project launching in the first week of July.

5. Terms and Conditions
    Detailed terms such as probation period, notice period, confidentiality clauses, and policies will be part of the employment agreement you’ll sign on your joining day.
    I’ve asked Shilpa to schedule a Teams walkthrough to address any specific queries you may have regarding these terms.

6. Benefits and Perks
We provide the following employee benefits:
    Statutory Benefits: Health Insurance, Provident Fund (PF), and Gratuity
    Wellness & Lifestyle Perks:
        Complimentary dinner for employees working overlapping US hours
        Sponsored travel/stay  for honey moon trip if you are bachelor getting married during your employment with us
        Reimbursement for two self-development, yoga, or spiritual programs each year

@Shilpa Menon — Please coordinate a meeting with Ashwath to address any remaining questions and help complete the onboarding formalities.

Looking forward to having you on board, Ashwath. Let’s move forward and make a strong start together.

Warm regards,
Siva Dakshinamurthy
CEO, SignaTech

before addressing my concerns, I would like to establish all the things we have talked so far and agreed upon,

my concerns, 
1. lack of consistency and transparency
2. I don't even want a offer letter, but I do need a salary breakdown in mail. Which I ask doubts and discuss upon.
3. variable pay criteria and components must be stated in the offer letter, taking two week to figure out after signing the employment agreement and serving my probation period shouldn't be the time to discuss and finalise a significant part of my CTC, on the quote "trust the process" -  there is no process being followed that is my concern too.
4. regarding the compensation and re-evaluation, I negotiated for a increment in the fixed part of the salary not the variable part - this is inconsistent too, I understand bonuses are given on annual performance cycle.
5. as mentioned in the email, a new role as Data and AI engineer has been created specifically for me, which is more of a reason to provide me with these details, I understand we will asses my strength on the probation periods and provide a more clearer description later, but vague topics such as AI, Full stack, AI initiatives are not specific, because I asked for detailed specific document stating this.
6. It is standard procedure to the employment agreement/ appointment letter / contract - before formally accepting the offer letter, I shouldn't have to relocate in order to view and accept the agreement.

Final thoughts, the process getting basic information to be this tedious and the lack of transparency and inconsistency with this hiring process has fed me up. If signa is ready to provide with these details, I am willing to proceed with a teams call with shlipa to explain the breakdown, but I do want all these information prior to make an informed decision.

Subject: Re: Offer for Data and AI Engineer - Ashwath - Seeking Final Clarity for Onboarding

Dear Siva,

Thank you for your detailed response and for addressing my follow-up questions regarding the offer for the Data and AI Engineer role. I genuinely appreciate your time and the insights into SignaTech's plans, particularly the new AI Enablement project. I remain very enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute my skills across Data, AI, and Full Stack initiatives.

To ensure mutual clarity and a smooth onboarding process, and importantly, for my peace of mind given that I have already resigned from my previous role based on this offer, it is crucial for me to have certain key details documented before I can formally accept the offer and initiate my relocation. Making a fully informed decision at this stage is paramount for me.

I understand SignaTech's process, but for the reasons outlined above, I respectfully request the following critical information and documents:

    Detailed Salary Breakdown: While I understand components are finalized at payroll, receiving an approximate breakup of the fixed annual compensation (Rs. 7,00,000/-) in writing (even via email) from Shilpa prior to my decision is essential. This allows me to properly understand the structure of my take-home pay.

    Variable Pay Criteria: The variable pay of Rs. 1,00,000/- constitutes a significant portion of my total compensation. It is crucial for me to have a clear framework or examples of how the performance criteria for this variable component are typically set and measured for a role of this nature, in writing, before joining. Understanding this framework upfront is vital, and relying on "trusting the process" without any defined guidelines for such a substantial part of my pay makes it difficult for me to commit.

    Compensation Re-evaluation and Bonuses: During our discussions, my negotiation for my package was specifically for an increment in the fixed part of the salary, not the variable component. The current understanding introduces an inconsistency that needs to be clarified. I would greatly appreciate a written confirmation regarding the scope of this re-evaluation. While I understand bonuses are linked to annual performance, clarity on the re-evaluation of the fixed component is important. I also respectfully note that the reason provided for the lower initial fixed offer (ie. not following a standard hiring procedure) does not align with the trust I've already placed in this offer.

    Role and Responsibilities: I am very excited about the new role as Data and AI Engineer, specifically created for me, and the verbal promise of 50% of time allocation to AI. To align expectations, I would appreciate receiving a standard document or a detailed overview outlining the core responsibilities and description for this role, and how the 50% AI allocation will be implemented or documented. While I understand we will assess my strengths during probation, having this upfront clarity for a custom-created role is essential.

    Employment Agreement Terms: My concern remains still, It is standard professional practice to review all terms and conditions, including clauses on probation period, notice period, confidentiality, and other company policies, before formally accepting an offer. Relocating and then being presented with a legally binding document on the day of joining would put me in a very difficult and pressured position. Therefore, I respectfully request to receive a draft of the employment agreement prior to my joining date.

I prefer to receive all of the above-mentioned documents in writing before scheduling the Teams walkthrough with Shilpa. This will allow me to thoroughly review them and prepare any specific questions, ensuring a productive discussion.

I am more eager and excited than ever to onboard with SignaTech and contribute to your projects. However, proceeding without these fundamental details places undue pressure on me and makes me hesitate. I have already demonstrated my trust. I understand the urgency of the  AI project that is starting soon and I want to move forward faster by understanding and documenting all aspects of my employment.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. I look forward to your positive response and receiving the requested documents soon.

Warm regards,

Ashwath

Hi Ashwath, 

Thank you for your questions. Please find below detailed responses:

1. **Detailed Salary Breakdown:** 

The salary structure includes standard statutory deductions such as Provident Fund (PF) and Professional Tax (PT). Additionally, deductions for health insurance will be applicable based on your selected coverage (self, spouse, children, parents, etc.). The final insurance deduction will be determined once your dependent details are confirmed during onboarding. 

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**CTC BREAKUP**|   |   |
|**PARTICULAR**|**MONTHLY(₹)**|**ANNUAL(₹)**|
|**FIXED EARNINGS**|||
|BASIC (50% ON GROSS)|29167|350000|
|HRA (40% ON BASIC)|11667|140000|
|**FLEXIBLE PAY**|14146|169765|
|**GROSS SALARY (A)**|**54980**|**659765**|
|**DEFERRALS**|||
|EMPLOYER PF|1950|23400|
|GRATUITY @ 4.81% ON BASIC|1403|16835|
|**TOTAL DEFERRALS (B)**|**3353**|**40235**|
|**TOTAL FIXED PAY (E) =(A+B)**|**58333**|**700000**|
|**DEDUCTIONS**|||
|PROVIDENT FUND|1800|21600|
|PROFESSIONAL TAX|208|2500|
|**TOTAL DEDUCTION (D)**|**2008**|**24100**|
|**TAKE HOME SALARY (A-D)**|**52972**|**635665**|
|**VARIABLE PERFORMANCE PAY(F)**||**100000**|

2. **Variable Pay Criteria:**

The variable component is performance-linked and evaluated during the company’s appraisal cycle. It is determined based on:

- **Individual Performance:** Achievement of KRAs, quality and timeliness of work, ownership, and contribution to team success.
- **Team/Department Performance:** Delivery against set targets, collaboration, and impact on departmental outcomes.
- **Company Performance:** Business growth, profitability, strategic execution, and overall financial health.

It is very difficult to establish this before your joining the job. We establish this once you join and allocated to a supervisor. This will be something that you and your supervisor will discuss and mutually agree

If you insist criteria, for the first quarter it'd be the following: 

1. Ontime delivery of assigned tasks for the first 3 months
2. 90% quality at the first-time delivery on all assigned tasks
3. 2 Linked in articles/blogs / Presentations on  relevant to Data , AI, or BI

**3. Compensation Re-evaluation and Bonuses:**  

During your interview with Pavan (Hiring Manager), you mutually agreed on a total annual compensation of ₹8,00,000, comprising ₹7,00,000 fixed and ₹1,00,000 variable pay. At SignaTech, it is our standard practice not to renegotiate compensation after the hiring manager has finalized and communicated the offer.

However, in this case, Siva has made a one-time exception to honor his personal commitment during your discussions. Please consider this a gesture of goodwill and trust.

We also want to clarify that your compensation may be revised based on your performance at the end of your probationary period. The revised total compensation could be up to ₹8,50,000 per year.

The structure of this revision, whether it reflects in the fixed component, the variable component, or a combination of both will depend entirely on your performance and work ethic.

For example, if you demonstrate a high level of ownership, self-drive, and the ability to take responsibility for outcomes without requiring close supervision, we may consider allocating the increment more toward fixed compensation.

Please understand: the purpose of the variable pay component is not to limit your earnings but to motivate and reward strong, well-rounded performance across all key areas.

Let us work together with mutual clarity and accountability toward your growth within the organization.

**Bonuses:**

In addition to your fixed and variable compensation, you may be eligible for a **year-end performance bonus**. This bonus is **not guaranteed** and will be awarded **entirely at the discretion of the company** based on both individual and organizational performance.

Eligibility for the bonus will be evaluated based on exceptional contributions beyond your core responsibilities, such as:

·         High **billability and utilization**.

·         Participation in **multiple billable or revenue-generating projects**.

·         Active involvement in **customer-facing roles** that enhance client satisfaction and retention.

Bonus consideration will also be directly tied to **overall company performance**, including revenue growth and business outcomes. Your individual contribution to that growth will be a key factor in the final determination.
